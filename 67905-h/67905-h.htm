<small>THE MAN ON THE ROAN HORSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">The</span> plan I have in my mind,&#8221; said Gersdorff, the
Minister, &#8220;is so full of delicacy and danger that I
hesitate to propose it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man sitting opposite to him smiled.
&#8220;At least, Excellency, let me hear it. May not the
man before whom the danger will lie be the best
judge of whether he can undertake it. As to the
delicacy involved&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Minister made a deprecating gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no fear on that score, so far as you are
concerned, my dear Herr Galabin. In fact you are
the only man in the Bureau whom I would trust to
undertake the affair. The only question is,&#8221; he
continued, as Galabin bowed in acknowledgment of
the compliment, &#8220;whether I have any right to risk
a valuable life in an undertaking where the very
courage which points you out as the right man for
the business is likely to minimize the dangers, dangers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
which I cannot disguise from myself may be
very great.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, I am impatient to hear your Excellency&#8217;s
plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Minister leaned back in his chair thoughtfully
stroking his mouth with his long white fingers.
&#8220;Shortly, it is this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The mystery surrounding
the extraordinary disappearance of Prince
Roel of Rapsberg deepens every day. I say deepens,
because, as you know, the agents of our Bureau, all
the machinery which we have set working to elucidate
it, have given us absolutely blank results. Had it
been a mere piece of eccentricity on the Prince&#8217;s part,
the result, as has been hinted, of disappointment in
a love affair, we must have found him, or at least
some clue to the direction in which he had disappeared.
A man, let alone a prince, cannot vanish
from the face of the earth without leaving some
trace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is obvious, Excellency, at any rate in a
well-watched community.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so. Now&mdash;and I doubt not you will have
come to the same conclusion as myself&mdash;the result
which our exhaustive inquiries leave us is the inevitable
conclusion that the Prince has been spirited
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think that, Excellency?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gersdorff nodded. &#8220;I do. And my supposition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
has the deeper colour in that I can easily account for
it. Now, in suggesting, my dear Herr Galabin, that
you should take this matter in hand and endeavour
to follow up the mystery on political, that is altogether
higher, lines, I feel it is only due to you to
point out the danger of playing the detective, seeing
that we accept the theory that this is not a mere
ordinary case of a person&#8217;s disappearance, due to
eccentricity or commonplace foul play. Behind it
I fear we have a strong, ruthless, political motive.
And a motive springing from one of the strongest,
most Napoleonic brains in Europe, and at the back of
that policy the might of a great Power.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is fighting against tremendous odds, certainly,
to follow the matter up,&#8221; Galabin remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;True. Still, we have no alternative. We may
be comparatively weak and insignificant in the
European concert, but for all that we cannot allow
this outrage to pass. Here is one of the richest and
most influential of our great territorial nobles kidnapped
under our very noses. For the sudden disappearance
of such a man can scarcely be accounted
for otherwise. Now are we to leave this young
Prince to his fate? Supposing, that is, he has not
already met it. Although my own idea is&mdash;and that
is the reason, Herr Galabin, I am anxious to enlist
your services&mdash;that the Russian, strong though he
be, will scarcely venture to put Prince Roel to death,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
at least until he has ascertained with some certainty
the effect such an outrage would produce and the
consequences he would have to face. No, he will
not burn his boats until he is sure how the land lies
in front of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the motive for making away with Prince
Roel?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gersdorff gave a shrug. &#8220;The old, wearisome
motive that is responsible for ninety-nine hundredths
of the world&#8217;s unrest. The policy of aggression.
The Prince owns an immense territory on the very
borders of the debatable land between Baratora and
Sorusk, a province which is kept in a ferment by
Karatieff&#8217;s agents with a view to its ultimate annexation
in the interests of peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Prince Roel is, I can quite understand, a
stumbling-block in the way of our friend&#8217;s policy.
For, young as he is, he wields great power; he is
practically an independent sovereign on his own
territory; moreover he has, it is known, imbibed
from his father a hatred of Russian aggression.
Gorodov has tried to get round him, but with no
success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so he falls back on <i>force majeure</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a bold stroke, and one which I should dearly
like to defeat,&#8221; Gersdorff said with a touch of professional
rivalry and zeal which the other could well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
understand. &#8220;If once we can make sure what has
become of Prince Roel his restoration to liberty will
follow as a matter of course. It will be the price of
our secrecy over the affair. Karatieff cannot afford
to stand convicted to-day of such medi&aelig;val tactics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, clearly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is bound to be a storm of some sort,&#8221;
Gersdorff proceeded. &#8220;Karatieff no doubt is prepared
for that, and the only question which he has
to calculate is the degree of its severity. It is already
breaking out in Prince Roel&#8217;s own country.
Urgent representations have already reached this
Bureau; the poor fellow&#8217;s mother has given me a
painful hour this morning. There is much talk of
vengeance if a hair of his head is injured. The
Magyars are a dangerous race when roused, but what
can they do against Karatieff? No; their attitude
may be heroic, but it is eminently unpractical. We
must play the fox, not the lion. Let me only find
out what has actually become of the Prince, and I
will engage to bring Karatieff to his knees. Now,
may we count on you, Herr Galabin? I can promise
you that the royal gratitude will take a very
practical shape, and as for expenses, why, you have
<i>carte blanche</i>. You know the country and the
language, you have courage and <i>savoir faire</i>, and I
could not choose a better man for what is, I admit,
a rather forlorn hope. I don&#8217;t want your answer at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
this moment. We can give you a few hours. It is
hardly an affair to be entered upon lightly, although
at the same time a too serious frame of mind is to be
avoided. Now, will you give me the pleasure of
your company at luncheon?&#8221;</p>

<p>They went in together to the dining-room. At
the door Gersdorff laid his hand on his guest&#8217;s arm
and said quietly, &#8220;It will be well perhaps not to
allude to this matter before the servants. Experience
has taught me the impossibility of being too
cautious. We have a saying in our Service, &#8216;Three
pairs of ears, one spy.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>After luncheon they lighted cigars and sat in the
bow window looking down on the busy K&ouml;nigstrasse,
the principal thoroughfare of the city. The old
Minister&#8217;s casual comments on the details of the
moving, thronging life beneath them were shrewd
and amusing, and the idle half-hour passed agreeably
enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you see this man riding up the street towards
us on the roan horse?&#8221; Gersdorff asked, suddenly
breaking off from the general to the particular.
&#8220;Now there is a fellow who is rather a puzzle to our
intelligence department.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; Galabin asked, looking curiously
at the object of the remark as he drew
nearer.</p>

<p>The rider was a dark, well set-up man about thirty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
or forty with something of a Greek cast of countenance.
Certainly at a casual glance an undeniably
handsome fellow, with a lithe figure and a perfect
seat on horseback.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a Count Zarka,&#8221; Gersdorff answered. &#8220;He
lives right away on the eastern borders of the country
among the mountains, but he is often here, staying
sometimes for several weeks together and living in
expensive style. Now the curious thing about him
is that he seems suddenly and strangely to have become
rich&mdash;no one knows how. His father, the last
Count, was poor, living in a half-ruined castle among
the mountains; this man has, we hear, turned the
dilapidated old place into an almost palatial residence
where he keeps a certain state. He appeared
suddenly a year or two back in society here with
a great flourish and all the surroundings of large
wealth. Whence does it come? Report says he has
been singularly lucky at the gaming-tables; but that
would hardly account for more than a temporary
state of affluence. Yes,&#8221; he continued musingly,
&#8220;I shall have to find out the real source of the Herr
Count&#8217;s wealth as soon as we have discovered Prince
Roel. Another mission waiting for you, my adventurous
young friend. Ah! here he comes back
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sharp ring of the horse&#8217;s hoofs sounded on
the stones below them; then abruptly ceased.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
&#8220;He is coming in,&#8221; Gersdorff exclaimed in some surprise,
not unmingled, however, with a certain astute
satisfaction. &#8220;Now I wonder what he can want
here with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin had glanced round in time to see the
Count dismount and saunter up the broad steps of
the Chancellerie. Presently one of the secretaries
came in and told his chief that Count Zarka was
anxious to see him for a few moments on an urgent
private matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;To see me?&#8221; Gersdorff repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one else, Excellency. The communication
the Herr Graf has to make is for your private ear. If
your Excellency is engaged&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. I will see the Count&mdash;in my room.
Now,&#8221; he observed to Galabin as the secretary left
them, &#8220;I may, perhaps, be able to find out something
of this matter. I have my suspicions of the
Herr Graf, and should not be surprised if he comes
to hoodwink me. Do me the favour to smoke another
cigar here till I can rejoin you. I may be able
to set an explicit plan before you.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a courtly bow he left the young man and
passed through to his private bureau. As he entered,
the Count, who was scrutinizing an engraving on the
wall, turned sharply. He had the easy vivacious
manner of a polished man of the world, and his
appearance was prepossessing enough except that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
the beauty of the face was spoilt by the wolfish
expression of the restless eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;To what cause am I indebted for the honour of
this visit, Count? What is the important matter
you wish to communicate?&#8221; Gersdorff never
wasted time in preliminary small-talk unless he had
an object in such trifling. And here with this man
there was none.</p>

<p>&#8220;The matter, Excellency, on which I have called
to give you certain information,&#8221; replied the Count
with a self-possession which the experienced reader
of men noticed with a certain dubious admiration,
&#8220;is one to which I fancy the Government will attach
great importance. I refer to the mysterious disappearance
of Prince Roel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes. We shall be glad to have any tangible
explanation of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The diplomatic mask was impenetrable, and the
sharp eyes saw nothing in the old Minister&#8217;s face
beyond a calm official interest, courteously inviting
him to proceed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should preface such evidence as I can produce,&#8221;
the Count continued, &#8220;by mentioning that
during the Prince&#8217;s last stay in this city I saw much
of him, indeed I may say that we were fairly intimate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A doubtful advantage to the Prince,&#8221; was the
other&#8217;s mental comment, but his visitor detected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
nothing beyond the slight bow with which the statement
was acknowledged.</p>

<p>&#8220;During our companionship,&#8221; Zarka proceeded,
&#8220;it came to my knowledge that the Prince had fallen
in love, or at least was deeply fascinated by a lady
he was in the habit of meeting in society.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gersdorff raised his bushy eyebrows in quiet surprise.
&#8220;You know the lady&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count gave an evasive shrug. &#8220;Only so far
as a guess will serve. The Prince gave me none of
his confidence on the subject, and my knowledge was
gathered simply from observation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man is lying,&#8221; Gersdorff said to himself.
Then aloud, &#8220;Your observation, Count, surely did
not stop short of the lady&#8217;s identity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must repeat I have no positive information
on that point,&#8221; Zarka maintained with a smile
that rather gave the lie to his words. &#8220;The Prince
was most reserved and secretive in the matter, and
I could not pretend to do more than hazard the
merest guess as to the lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gersdorff bowed as forbearing to press the question.
&#8220;Possibly the point is not essential,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I will not interrupt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, however, the poor Prince was greatly
smitten,&#8221; Zarka continued with a fluency which
seemed to his hearer the result of preparation, &#8220;was
clear to me. From a young man of high spirits he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
became gloomy, melancholy, with intervals of unnatural
excitement. The usual signs of a certain
state of mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gersdorff nodded him on in more curiosity than
the other suspected.</p>

<p>Zarka paused for a moment before proceeding, as,
having completed the preamble, he came to the real
point of his communication.</p>

<p>&#8220;In my mind there is no doubt,&#8221; he said slowly,
giving weight to his words, &#8220;that the Prince&#8217;s disappearance
is directly due to the failure of his love
affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Minister&#8217;s face assumed a look of bland inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed? That is a strong assertion, Count.
You have proof?&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka smiled, and his smile strengthened the
other&#8217;s dislike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Proof absolute, to my mind. Documentary evidence.&#8221;
He took out a gold-bound letter-case emblazoned
with an heraldic device. &#8220;A tangible
clue which I have felt it my duty to hand to your
Excellency,&#8221; he said, as with deliberation he opened
the case, took out a paper and carefully unfolded it.
&#8220;You know Prince Roel&#8217;s handwriting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Personally, no. But that is easily proved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it well,&#8221; Zarka returned. &#8220;And there
without the suspicion of a doubt is a specimen of it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>He rose as he spoke and handed the paper to
Gersdorff. It contained only a few words, and the
Minister read them, half aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I send you herewith two bunches of roses, white
and red. The white signify love and life: the red
hate and death. Those which you will wear to-night
must decide my fate. R.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Gersdorff turned the paper, and finding the
other side blank, turned it back slowly and read the
words over again. Then he laid the paper down on
the desk before him, and looked up inquiringly at
Zarka.</p>

<p>&#8220;The paper tells its own story, does it not?&#8221;
the Count said in reply to the look.</p>

<p>&#8220;To a certain point, yes. May I ask how you
came by it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the Prince&#8217;s servant who found it in the
pocket of his master&#8217;s smoking-jacket,&#8221; Zarka
answered readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he brought it to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To me as a friend of his master&#8217;s. It is evidently
a blotted draft which the Prince intended to destroy.
You notice, Excellency, the ink is spilt on it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gersdorff nodded. &#8220;I do not know that this
proves very much,&#8221; he observed doubtfully.</p>

<p>The Count drew back his lips, showing his teeth
in a characteristic but utterly mirthless smile. &#8220;Not
of itself, Excellency. But I should say that if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
were known that a certain lady to whom the flowers
were sent wore the red roses, why then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he
finished the sentence by an expressive shrug.</p>

<p>Perhaps had Count Zarka been able to read the
significance of the look which the old diplomatist&#8217;s
keen eyes fixed on him he might not have been quite
so glib. But clever man as a glance would recognize
the Count to be, he was here, perhaps, a little too
anxious to appear quite fluent and at his ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so, Count,&#8221; Gersdorff said, almost coldly.
&#8220;You can give me the lady&#8217;s name or not, as you
please. If not, no doubt we can find it out for ourselves.
It is merely a question of saving the Bureau
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka affected to hesitate, then to make up his
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my desire,&#8221; he said, with a bow, &#8220;to be of
every service to your Excellency. So I must break
what was my first resolve, namely that no lady&#8217;s
name should pass my lips in connexion with the
affair. You are welcome to know my suspicion so
far as it goes. I can at least tell you the name of
the lady who wore red roses at the Margravine von
Reuspach&#8217;s ball the night before Prince Roel
disappeared. Your Excellency may possibly be
acquainted with General Hainfeld?&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, with lips drawn back and his glittering
eyes fixed on Gersdorff, awaiting his answer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;I have met the General. Has he a daughter?&#8221;
the Minister answered doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;A step-daughter, Fr&auml;ulein Philippa Carlstein.&#8221;
He spoke the name with a curious staccato intonation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; Gersdorff made a mental note of it. Then
he waited, his intuition telling that the Count had
something to add.</p>

<p>&#8220;The General and Fr&auml;ulein Carlstein,&#8221; Zarka proceeded
when he found the other did not seem inclined
to question him further, &#8220;have left the city,
I hear, for Switzerland and Paris. That is all the
information I have to give, Excellency. You must
take it for what it is worth; but I must say it seems
to me significant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gersdorff rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so, Count,&#8221; he said curtly, as ending the
interview; &#8220;we will look into the matter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But his visitor did not depart without a flourish.
&#8220;I trust, Excellency, you will consider that what you
have done me the honour to allow me to communicate
has been a sufficient excuse for taking up so
much of your valuable time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; Gersdorff answered a little stiffly;
&#8220;I am obliged to you for your information; your
theory of this unfortunate young fellow&#8217;s disappearance
may be worth following up. You will leave
the paper with me? Good-day.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>The Count could only grin again, bow, and take
his leave.</p>

<p>Gersdorff returned to Galabin, who rose and looked
inquiringly at his face, which, however, from habitual
diplomatic schooling, told nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lucky visit for us,&#8221; Gersdorff said, resuming
his seat by the window. &#8220;I fancy it has at least
narrowed the field of your proposed search, my
young friend. For unless I am greatly mistaken the
man who is there,&#8221; he nodded down towards the
street, &#8220;mounting his horse with such swagger knows
as much as anybody of Prince Roel&#8217;s disappearance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He came to tell you so?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old diplomat smiled. &#8220;He came to throw
dust in my eyes. How foolish men are!&#8221; he exclaimed
reflectively. &#8220;When will they learn to hold
their tongues? A false scent is very well if only you
are dealing with people stupid enough to follow it.
Otherwise it is simply a negative clue, since we know
the object we are hunting has not gone that way.
Now, Herr Galabin,&#8221; he continued, resuming his
more business-like manner, &#8220;in the interests of our
State I want you to spend a holiday in the great
forest at the foot of the Carpathians.&#8221;</p>

<p>He touched a bell. &#8220;Ask Herr Botheim to come
to me,&#8221; he said to the man who answered it.</p>

<p>In a few moments Herr Botheim made his appearance,
a small, astute-looking man, with an intensely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
secretive manner. He was the head of the intelligence
department.</p>

<p>&#8220;Botheim, how long has Count Zarka been in the
city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since 7.40 this morning only, Excellency. He
left the city eight days ago presumably for Rozsnyo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Rozsnyo. Yes? Was his departure seen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Excellency. It appears to have been sudden
and secret. We only heard of his departure some
hours afterwards. There seemed no reason for suspecting&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, my good Botheim,&#8221; Gersdorff interrupted;
&#8220;there is no blame attached to your department,
but I fancy we have hardly studied the
Count closely enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Botheim could only give a shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not blame you,&#8221; the Minister proceeded;
&#8220;we have hitherto looked upon him, politically, as a
mysterious nonentity. But now we may have
reason to change our views. You have, of course,
information about the Count&#8217;s home, the Schloss
Rozsnyo? Its situation, I mean, and so forth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Excellency. I can obtain all the information
in two minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do so,&#8221; Gersdorff returned, &#8220;and furnish Herr
Galabin with it. I will send him to your room at
once.&#8221; Botheim bowed and withdrew. &#8220;You will
undertake this mission?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;I am only too much honoured, Excellency, by
your confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure it is well placed. You have two objects,
remember. First, to discover, if possible, what has
become of Prince Roel; and secondly, to find out
what you can about this Count Zarka. Now, good-bye.
Be wary. I do not trust the Count. Botheim
will give you all available information; we shall
look to you to add to it materially.&#8221;</p>

<small>A CHANCE SHOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> nearly horizontal rays of a setting September
sun, red with the promise of a brilliant resurrection
on the morrow, struck full against the great elevated
timber-line, where, at any rate for a space, European
civilization seems to be held in check by the appalling
ruggedness and grandeur&mdash;the insurmountable wildness
of self-assertive nature. The parting glory
falling directly on the fringe of the great coniferous
belt, threw into more striking relief the blue-black
intensity of the forest depths. The day had been
hot&mdash;sultry for the time of year, for September days
are, as it were, the Parthian cohort of Summer&#8217;s retreating
array: the air was still and silent with the
languor which comes of hours of steady, windless
heat. Only occasionally there rose from the impenetrable
blackness of the woods the lazy cry of
a pigeon or the whirr of a tree-partridge, so infrequent
as to be almost startling in contrast with
the prevailing stillness.</p>

<p>The nibbling hares, dotted at picturesque intervals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
over one at the tufted and sparsely wooded lawns
which here and there broke the continuity of the
interminable woods, munched and leaped peacefully
and comfortably enough. Presently by common
consent, not simultaneously, but by twos and
threes, and batches, they stopped their feeding,
raised their heads, and pricked their ears until the
whole company was at attention. A few tree-partridges,
preening their grey feathers, paused and looked
round inquiringly towards the black wood into
which they could see but a few yards, yet perhaps
further than any other living thing. The pause&mdash;of
alert expectancy&mdash;lasted but a few seconds. A
fox came with slinking trot out of the wood, and
made across the best covered corner of the lawn
towards the thickets opposite, increasing his pace
as he crossed the open, his eyes redder than normal,
for the sun struck full into them. Most of the hares
reassured, resumed their eclectic nibbling; a few,
impressed by Reynard&#8217;s gait and manner, leisurely
put a less distance between themselves and the
covert, plucking an occasional tempting blade on the
way.</p>

<p>There is a subtle magnetic influence acting from
animal life upon animal life. Unknown as its cause
is to us&mdash;for all our researches can never take us beyond
the border-line of half-knowledge, at least
this side of the grave&mdash;and imperfect as our conjectures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
are, we see clearly enough its influence the
more unmistakable in direct ratio to the sharpness
of the senses of the creature upon which it acts. We
feel it ourselves in the same proportion, keeping
time with our individual sensitiveness; but with
most of us, at any rate, distance attenuates the
subtle power. So, not without the grosser signs of
the sudden lifting, this time with one accord, of
scores of furry heads and ears, the warning cry of
pigeons behind the dark foliage, and the sudden
swift rush of the lately indolent tree-partridge, would
a human being have felt constrained to look expectingly
towards the fringe of the wood, the natural
line of which was now broken by the figure of a man.</p>

<p>He had stopped on emerging from the covert, and
now stood, set off picturesquely against his dark
background, perhaps admiring the romantic scene
suddenly opened before him, perhaps uncertain as
to his whereabouts. So motionless was his attitude,
so striking his appearance, that he hardly seemed to
lend a human interest to the fairy spot; an onlooker
from the opposite side of the valley would have expected
him to vanish as mysteriously as he had come.
Presently, however, he moved forward and began
to descend the slope. The hares, which had begun
to wonder whether there was any harm in him,
scampered away on all sides. The man at once
halted and made a quick movement of pointing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
gun he carried under his arm, but it seemed to be
merely the sportsman&#8217;s instinct, for he checked the
action ere he had aimed, and replacing the weapon
in its former position, resumed his way across the
now deserted valley.</p>

<p>A handsome man, of fair complexion and athletic
frame, dressed in a dark-green shooting suit, whose
easy swinging gait had nevertheless a suggestion of
military precision and alertness. His figure, standing
out against the dark background, was picturesque
enough; even the modern fashion of his clothes
scarcely detracted from the suggestion of romance
in his appearance; his coat was thrown open, and
there seemed a characteristic touch of a bygone
age in the dress which harmonized so perfectly with
his old-world surroundings.</p>

<p>Ascending the lesser elevation on the farther side
of the valley he passed in again among the great firs;
but now the woods grew lighter as he walked, his
course after a while tending downwards. Soon he
emerged again into the red sunlight, and upon a far
greater extent of comparatively open country than
the gap in the woods he had lately crossed. Here
he came upon a third essential of perfect beauty in
scenery&mdash;a rushing stream of water, dancing and
sparkling between its sedgy banks as though rejoicing
in the change from the barren blackness of
its mountain source to the warm luxuriance at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
which it had now arrived. A short distance below,
as its bed grew wider and smoother, the stream became
less turbulent, and soon subsided into a placidity
marred only by the leaping fish.</p>

<p>The sportsman, however, had for the moment
turned the other way, walking some two hundred
yards to where it was possible to cross the stream,
using the boulders in its course as stepping-stones.
On reaching the other side he walked down the
bank, not very far before halting to light a cigar.
Having done this he still lingered, curiously attracted
by a movement of the water under the
opposite bank, now some distance off, for the stream
had suddenly widened. It was a slight regular
splashing, not natural to the spot, for the movement
of the water seemed objective not subjective. He
could not see whence it proceeded, the cause, in
foreign, being hidden by the reeds and sedge which
luxuriated along the bank. To resolve his doubts
he took up his gun, quietly slipped a cartridge into
it, and carelessly fired at the spot. Almost simultaneously
there rose the cry not of bird or beast, but
of a human being, and above the tops of the rushes
directly appeared the head of&mdash;a woman.</p>

<p>In a moment the quiet imperturbability of the
man vanished. Startled and shocked, he shouted
vehement apologies; then set off running back to
the place where the stream was fordable. Here in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
his hurry, he made a false step on the uneven surface
of the stones and only just saved himself from falling
into the water. He scrambled up and across and,
running down the bank, soon pushed his way through
the reeds and reached the lady whom he had unwittingly
fired at.</p>

<p>That she was young and good-looking accounted,
perhaps, for his precipitate haste; when he came
face to face with her he told himself that his rush
and scramble were fully justified.</p>

<p>A tall distinguished-looking girl stood before him;
the handsomest specimen of female humanity he had
seen for many a long day, glancing at him with an
expression of half annoyance, half curiosity, but
with the perfect self-possession that only a high-bred
woman is capable of. There was no self-consciousness,
no aiming at effect. She seemed to trouble
herself very little about the man by whose act she
might at that moment be lying dead where she now
stood; vouchsafing him little more than a casual
glance, and receiving his profuse apologies with no
reciprocal excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have hit you, mad fool that I was! That
is blood on your dress?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a dark stain on the girl&#8217;s brown travelling
skirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; some shot hit my hand,&#8221; she replied
coolly, bringing forward her left hand bound with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
her handkerchief the delicate texture of which was
absorbing blood like blotting paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! What can I say! Do let me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And ruined my gown,&#8221; she went on in the same
calm voice, contrasting curiously with his excited
tone. &#8220;Or perhaps it was my fault. I should have
held my hand out of harm&#8217;s way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pulled out a folded handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me offer you this. Can you staunch the
bleeding till I fetch a doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>She reached for the handkerchief without looking
at her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. I will take that. But you need
not bother about a doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely you will allow me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She interrupted him with the same equable voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will direct me to the nearest road to
Gorla&#8217;s Farm, I won&#8217;t trouble you any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>His look of concern was gradually changing to one
of puzzled surprise. He could not make her out,
nor tell whether she was seriously offended with him
or not, so little emotion, or even expression, did she
evince. His self-reproaches and vehement apologies
seemed to go for nothing. The girl made even
less of them than she did of her wounded hand, and
she regarded that coolly enough. But a man does not,
even unwittingly, inflict bodily harm on another,
still less on a woman, without feeling genuine regret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
for it, and this man could not at once check his expressions
of sorrow, cavalierly as they were received.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not to blame,&#8221; the girl said at last with
decision. &#8220;It was a pure accident; it was my own
fault. I had no business to play hide and seek in a
shooting ground. I ought to have known better and
may be thankful the affair is no worse. And if it
had been&mdash;&mdash;. Now, as it is getting late I must be
making my way homewards.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked surprised. &#8220;Do you live in these
wilds?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed. &#8220;You did not think there was any
habitation, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except Rozsnyo.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought her face changed curiously. At any
rate the smile died out of it. &#8220;I am not bound
there,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;We are living for the time
at an old farm, the Meierhof Gorla. My father has
come for sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, too, is my reason for being here,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But I am a gipsy&mdash;for the time. I have a travelling
cart and a tent, pitched over yonder&#8221;&mdash;he
pointed across the valley&mdash;&#8220;my name is Osbert Von
Tressen, and I have the honour to hold the rank of
lieutenant in the second regiment of cavalry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father&#8217;s name,&#8221; she told him in return, &#8220;is
Harlberg. We live, when we care for civilization, in
town. But I love forest life.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>&#8220;You have enough of it here,&#8221; he returned drily.
&#8220;I thought perhaps you had come from the Schloss
Rozsnyo. You know Count Zarka?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment, and then said, &#8220;Yes,
we know him. Do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; only by&mdash;reputation.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a quick glance at him as though to detect
a significance in the last word. If she seemed
tempted to ask him what that reputation was, she
refrained.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; he asked sympathetically, &#8220;your hand
is not very painful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It hurts very little. I had no idea shot was so
painless.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had come to the crossing-place over the
stream; Von Tressen, going first and stepping backwards,
handed her safely across.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care,&#8221; he warned her midway. &#8220;I slipped
on that stone myself just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not fall in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saved myself at the expense of a wet foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him in a little amused commiseration.
&#8220;How uncomfortable you must be! Do not
let me keep you. I had rather lost my bearings, but
if you can tell me the point to make for I can easily
find my way home.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed. &#8220;I should have felt infinitely more
uncomfortable if I left you now. I had really forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
my damp boot. I hope my company is not
offensive to you as, after all my folly, I fear it ought
to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I am not vindictive
enough to send you away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have forgiven me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what? I brought the accident on myself.
I was tired and hot and thought it would be pleasant
to lie down among the cool rushes and paddle my
hand in the water, forgetting I ran the risk of
being taken for a water-fowl or water-rat. There is
nothing to forgive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never forgive myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may easily,&#8221; she returned.</p>

<p>They walked on in silence for a time over the thick,
springy, plush-like turf. The girl seemed preoccupied,
and her companion had too much tact to
force her to talk. Presently she asked, &#8220;Have you
had good sport to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A big bag of small game which my man has
taken to the tent. I have been obliged to shoot
alone, as a brother officer who was to have joined
me cannot get leave just yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were passing now through a little wood,
their talk languishing strangely; it was, in fact,
awkward and disjointed, the girl was <i>distraite</i>, and
a strange spell seemed to be on the man.</p>

<p>As they emerged from the wood a glorious landscape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
lay before them. A great valley, broken up
into a thousand tints of light and shade by the
setting sun which played among rock and
thicket, here and there catching a bend of the glinting
stream which wound its way through it. Beyond
rose a purple backing of millions of pines, and
above and beyond them again the snow-capped
mountains in all their stern grandeur.</p>

<p>The girl stopped for a moment. &#8220;How lovely!&#8221;
She spoke without the least suspicion of gush; it
was a genuine expression of delight, perhaps curbed
by the presence of her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;the valley looks beautiful to-day,
but, to my thinking, it looks grandest under a
stormy sky.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was looking towards a spot where, high up
on the pine-clad hill a great splash of crimson fire
sparkled and glinted, glowing with a brilliancy
which tinged the woods around it with its own
blood-red colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Schloss Rozsnyo stands well,&#8221; he observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like a fairy palace,&#8221; she commented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Quite a show place,
built half upon, half inside the rock, I am told.
Most romantic, but singularly out of the way in these
regions. It seems sheer waste. But then the
Count, no doubt, is a man of peculiar ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>His last remark was half a question, but the girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
did not answer it. He was not exactly sorry to
notice that her interest in Rozsnyo and its owner
did not seem to be altogether of an agreeable nature.</p>

<p>They turned and walked on. She was busy with
her thoughts now, he could see; and he forebore to
interrupt them. As they turned into one of the
broad glades that intersected the forest, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is an afternoon of surprises after my week&#8217;s
solitude. Who comes here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s look followed his. A few hundred yards
away, coming towards them at a leisurely trot, was a
horseman.</p>

<p>As they and the rider drew nearer, an idea struck
Von Tressen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if by any chance this is the man we
have been speaking of&mdash;Count Zarka?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was quite within recognizable distance now.
But it seemed from her absence of curiosity&mdash;for
she kept her eyes from the advancing figure&mdash;that
Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg had known him at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes it is,&#8221; she answered curtly.</p>

<p>Von Tressen, in the glance which he could not
resist, saw her face set with a peculiar look of suppressed
feeling, almost of defiance. Next moment
the Count was reining up in front of them. The
two men raised their hats, but Zarka&#8217;s eyes were
upon the girl. They had probably already taken
in her companion during the approach.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg,&#8221; he said with a certain
suavity of manner, &#8220;I just did myself the
honour to call at the farm and found your father a
little concerned at your long absence. Knowing the
danger of losing one&#8217;s way in the forest I offered to
go in search of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very good of you, Count,&#8221; the girl replied
almost indifferently. &#8220;But I was hardly in danger
of being quite lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count now turned his attention to Von
Tressen, looking at him with a peculiar wolfish smile,
which was at the same time no smile at all, but just
the mask of one. &#8220;I see, Fr&auml;ulein, you have already
found an efficient escort. You have been shooting
in the forest, mein Herr?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfortunately?&#8221; The Count took up the word
quickly, with a snap, as it were, and glanced with a
smile of protest at the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most unfortunately,&#8221; the Lieutenant repeated.
&#8220;I have unhappily hit the Fr&auml;ulein.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Zarka echoed his words, drawing back his
lips into an expression of incredulity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing,&#8221; the girl said a little impatiently.</p>

<p>But it had occurred to Von Tressen that it would
be just as well to mention the accident. Zarka
looked to him the man inevitably to find it out;
besides which it seemed due to the girl that their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
chance acquaintanceship should be accounted
for.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Fr&auml;ulein is good enough to make light of
it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it is desirable that a doctor
should see her hand without delay. Therefore,
perhaps, the Herr Graf will pardon me if I suggest
that we move on.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Herr Graf did not look exactly in a pardoning
mood, although the suave smile was still on his face.
He wheeled his horse. &#8220;I will do myself the pleasure
of bearing you company to the Meierhof,&#8221; he
said in a tone which had in it less of a suggestion
than a determination. &#8220;Perhaps then I may be
allowed to ride into Kulhausen for a doctor. It will
be quickest.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had moved on together, the Count walking
his horse abreast of them and in his insinuating way
trying to draw out a circumstantial account of the
accident. At a turn in the forest road Von Tressen
said, &#8220;It is properly I, the culprit, who should go
for the doctor. I cannot allow you, Count, to take
the trouble. I have a horse at my camp and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he felt a pressure on his arm. The
girl had given him a warning touch. Zarka signified
by an indifferent bow that he accepted Von
Tressen&#8217;s suggestion. But his face grew a shade
darker as Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is really no hurry. We can easily send<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
from the farm. My father will naturally think it
right, Herr Lieutenant, that you should come and
make his acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count gave a tolerant smile, which probably
served to mask some darker expression, and the three
went on together a short half-mile to the house,
Zarka chatting volubly and Von Tressen wondering
why the girl had so manifestly objected to his leaving
them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>A MOMENTOUS MEETING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gorla&#8217;s Meierhof</span>, or Grange, was a picturesque
house which had been converted into a kind of
shooting-box from a farmhouse, which, in turn, had
been adapted from the ruins of an ancient building
left centuries before by the Turks. It was a rough
and primitive abode, but one which in that wild
country would be considered comfortable enough
and a not undesirable summer mountain residence,
situated as it was on the fringe of the vast hill
forests and commanding a view along the great
sweep of the valley.</p>

<p>As the three approached the house they saw a
man sitting before it smoking and reading a newspaper.
At the sound of their voices he turned his
head, then rose and sauntered to meet them. He
was small but well set-up, somewhat dandified
even in the loose lounging suit he wore; there was
a good deal of the town man, Von Tressen thought,
in his appearance and manner, and, what struck
him forcibly, a decided military air in his carriage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
This rather surprised him, for had the other been a
soldier he would surely at his age have borne a high
military title, whereas the Count had distinctly alluded
to him more than once as plain Herr Harlberg.
But that he had seen enough soldiering to have
acquired a manifest military bearing was to the
Lieutenant&#8217;s mind a certainty.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last!&#8221; Harlberg exclaimed, a little peevishly
Von Tressen thought. &#8220;My dear Philippa, where
have you been wandering?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so far, father,&#8221; she answered, with a laugh,
and she introduced Von Tressen, who had been the
object of his rather suspicious scrutiny.</p>

<p>The accident was related and the Lieutenant&#8217;s
apologies accepted not ungraciously; the Count,
who had dismounted and led his horse up the ascent
to the house, standing in silence with his lips drawn
back in the inevitable smile. At length he spoke,
and it was to the purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Herr Lieutenant has most kindly offered to
ride into Kulhausen for a doctor to see Fr&auml;ulein
Philippa&#8217;s hand. Dare one suggest that the
sooner it is professionally examined the better it
will be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no hurry; it hardly pains at all,&#8221; the
girl protested.</p>

<p>For an instant the expression on the Count&#8217;s
sharp face was not a pretty one. But he replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
merely by a shrug of mingled protest and annoyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. I am going at once,&#8221; Von Tressen
said, watching the girl&#8217;s face involuntarily for a sign.
&#8220;I only came so far, sir,&#8221; he added to Harlberg,
&#8220;at the desire of the Fr&auml;ulein, who was good enough
to express a wish to present me to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how will you get to Kulhausen?&#8221; Harlberg
asked, with what seemed to the young man a rather
too suggestive glance at the Count&#8217;s horse.</p>

<p>Anyhow Zarka accepted it with some alacrity.
&#8220;If the Lieutenant will honour me by making use
of my horse, it will be the quickest way, and I shall
be only too charmed.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he turned to the animal to bring him over,
Von Tressen instinctively glanced at the girl. She
was biting her lip, and as their eyes met she gave a
little, almost imperceptible, shake of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Herr Lieutenant,&#8221; she said, &#8220;tells us he
also has a horse close by. If he is kind enough to
ride over to Kulhausen it would be perhaps a pity
to deprive the Count of his means of getting home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count, however, did not seem to look at the
proposed arrangement in that light. &#8220;I should be
only too content and pleased to wait,&#8221; he protested.
&#8220;There, Herr Lieutenant&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He brought the horse round for Von Tressen to
mount. But the hint had not been lost.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>&#8220;I could not think of inconveniencing the Count,&#8221;
he objected resolutely. &#8220;And it is absurd when
my own horse is so near.&#8221; He made as though to
move off. Zarka for a moment forgot his somewhat
oppressive politeness.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is waste of time, man!&#8221; he hissed rather than
spoke. &#8220;Take the horse; he will carry you well.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the other was resolved he would not be forced.
He could not quite guess the reason of the girl&#8217;s
anxiety, but he did not like the Count, and could
understand that he might not be singular in his
antipathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! Not for the world!&#8221; he cried, backing
off. &#8220;Herr Harlberg, Fr&auml;ulein, I have the honour.
<i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>&#8221; He turned and ran off, divided
between amusement at the Count&#8217;s furious disgust
and pleasure at the look of thanks in Fr&auml;ulein
Philippa&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>Zarka smoothed the strong muscles of his expressive
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;An obstinate young Bursche,&#8221; he observed
spitefully. &#8220;I hope the dangers of our forest are
not to be increased by these mad marksmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was entirely my own fault that he fired and
hit me,&#8221; the girl said emphatically, as though
annoyed at his tone. &#8220;You, Count, or any other
sportsman, would have fired under the same provocation.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>The Count could smile again; he had evidently
quite recovered his equanimity. &#8220;Then I can only
congratulate myself that I was not in a position
to inflict harm on you,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;You are
not going, Fr&auml;ulein?&#8221; for, with a slight bow as
disdaining further argument, she had turned towards
the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I am tired with my long walk. I bid
you good-evening, Count.&#8221; And she left them.</p>

<p>The two men did not speak till she was out of
earshot. Then Harlberg remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;It might have been an awkward <i>contretemps</i>,
Count. As it is, I used to know this young fellow&#8217;s
father. He was a cavalryman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka gave a shrug. &#8220;It is nothing. The
Lieutenant is of no account and an unsuspecting&#8221;&mdash;soldier,
he was going to say, but substituted&mdash;&#8220;young
swaggerer. I shall keep my eye on him.
I gather that he is camping in the forest alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope he likes it,&#8221; Harlberg said wearily. &#8220;I
find it dull enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count laughed unsympathetically. &#8220;You
miss the K&ouml;nigstrasse, my friend. Patience! It
will not be for long. The grass will soon have grown
over this excitement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have heard no news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None. Except that the search is active.
Naturally. A prince is a prince even though he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
be a fool, and cannot be allowed to disappear like
a rag-picker. Well, good-evening, General&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; Harlberg held up a silencing hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is all safe here,&#8221; Zarka laughed in his
masterful fashion. &#8220;There is no one to overhear
us. You may trust me not to make a slip at the
wrong time. I shall see you to-morrow, and, I
hope, Fr&auml;ulein Philippa.&#8221;</p>

<p>So with a sweeping glance at the house he mounted
and rode off.</p>

<p>Harlberg went in and, lighting a fresh cigar, took
up a novel and proceeded to make himself as comfortable
as the place permitted. He had scarcely
settled himself in the easiest chair the room afforded
when his step-daughter came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count has gone?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered casually, glancing up from
the book. &#8220;He talks of coming again to-morrow.
He is an agreeable fellow and will enliven our exile.
By the way, my dear girl,&#8221; he went on in a voice
of languid expostulation, &#8220;you must take care of
yourself in the forest. How foolish of you to play
the water-rat. Lucky the fellow was a bad shot
and only hit your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was hardly a question of his being a bad
shot,&#8221; the girl replied indifferently. &#8220;He could
see nothing to aim at except the movement of my
hand, and he hit that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;It is unfortunate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; the wound is absurdly slight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant,&#8221; he said a little querulously, &#8220;the
fact of the Lieutenant&#8217;s breaking in upon our
privacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not see,&#8221; she returned, &#8220;that we have
anything to fear. I thought you would be glad
of company beyond our own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so. But under the circumstances, perhaps
the fewer acquaintances we make the better.
We have always the Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;we have always the Count.
Father,&#8221; she added suddenly with a change of tone,
&#8220;I do not care for Count Zarka&#8217;s attentions.&#8221;</p>

<p>His look of surprise was rather obviously unreal.
&#8220;Have they been very marked?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered drily, &#8220;because I have not
given him the chance. Only I think it well you
should know I do not care to see very much of
Count Zarka.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw out his hands deprecatingly. &#8220;Of
course you know best, my dear. Only,&#8221; he added,
changing from a resigned to a persuasive tone, &#8220;I
should have imagined you would not have slighted
the chance of an alliance with a man of the Count&#8217;s
wealth and position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And character?&#8221; The sharp question made
him feel uncomfortable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>&#8220;Do you know anything against his character?&#8221;
he inquired blandly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing definite,&#8221; she answered quietly. &#8220;But
I am not a fool, and Count Zarka&#8217;s personality
does not seem to me to belie a certain evil reputation
which I believe he enjoys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Philippa&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began, but she cut him short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apart from this, father, I do not like Count
Zarka, and I think he knows it. Anyhow, I have
told you now so that there may be no misunderstanding
or cross purposes between us on the subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa spoke quietly, but with a slight tremor
in her voice which betrayed the feelings she repressed.
She knew well how little affection her step-father
really had for her. A handsome, vivacious girl,
much admired wherever she appeared, her companionship
was far less irksome to her sole guardian
than might have been the case had she been plain
and uninteresting. She knew all this, and although
she accepted it as the inevitable logic of her step-father&#8217;s
character, which was to have a real affection
for no one outside his own skin, yet she rebelled
at the idea of being disposed of to suit his convenience.</p>

<p>Harlberg spread out his hands in a gesture of
protestation. &#8220;I have nothing to do with it,
my dear,&#8221; he said, almost petulantly. &#8220;You are
quite old enough to choose for yourself; and if our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
friend Count Zarka wishes to marry you, why, he
has a tongue in his head, and a pretty glib one too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only wish you not to encourage him in that
idea,&#8221; Philippa said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be sure I shall not,&#8221; he replied,
taking up his novel again with a suggestion that
argument was fatiguing, and he did not feel just
then in the humour for it. The girl was far from
sure, but, realizing the uselessness of further discussion,
she said no more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile Lieutenant Von Tressen had saddled
his horse and ridden post haste in search of the
doctor. Having found the only practitioner of
which the little place boasted, and arranged for
him to come out to Gorla&#8217;s Farm without delay,
he was starting back again, when he saw on the other
side of the street a face which he recognized.</p>

<p>&#8220;Galabin!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;So it is, by Jupiter.
Why, Horaz, my friend, what on earth brings you
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other man, on hearing his name called out,
had glanced up quickly with a look of mingled
suspicion and annoyance. But on recognizing
Von Tressen his expression changed to a smile;
he went across and shook hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth are you doing in these outlandish
parts?&#8221; the Lieutenant repeated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>&#8220;Is it only in the military service that men take
holidays?&#8221; Galabin retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;A holiday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not, my friend? Do we spend our leave
in town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But here? Why, Horaz, you are never
married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And on my honeymoon? No, thank you. I
have come for the mountains and a little sport in the
forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So? That is good to hear. I, too, am staying
in the forest under canvas for sport. You must
join me. The deer-stalking will begin in a few
days. It will be glorious. You know Molvar of
my regiment? He has deserted me. We arranged
the expedition together, and at the last moment
he cried off. Ah, well, he could not help it. If
you are in earnest you shall take his place. I can
promise you fine sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin&#8217;s face had become thoughtful, almost
business-like. &#8220;You are camping in the forest?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Anywhere near the Schloss Rozsnyo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At present I am within half an hour&#8217;s walk of
it. By the way, do you know Count Zarka?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I. Perhaps you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I met him just now for the first time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An agreeable fellow, eh?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>&#8220;H&#8217;m! Yes, doubtless. Now, my dear Horaz,
will you join me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow? Yes, I shall be delighted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. I will come in the morning and
fetch you and your traps.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE UNACCOUNTABLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning, as in duty bound, Von Tressen
stopped on his way to Kulhausen to inquire after
Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg&#8217;s injury. The surgeon had pronounced
it to be trifling, had extracted a shot and
answered for a speedy healing.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see,&#8221; Philippa said to the Lieutenant,
&#8220;you have nothing to reproach yourself with.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had come out of the house to greet him, her
father not being visible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have indeed,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;when I think
how awful the result might have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a curiously informal introduction,&#8221; she
said laughingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is to me the only pleasant aspect of the
affair. I feel inclined never to fire a gun again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not say that. You should have good
sport to-day if my wishes were of any avail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t deserve,&#8221; he said self-reproachfully,
&#8220;that you should be so forgiving.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>&#8220;A woman,&#8221; she replied&mdash;and as she spoke her
eyes rested on him with a sort of wistful trust&mdash;&#8220;can
afford to overlook in a man slight failings in
consideration of qualities she respects.&#8221;</p>

<p>He coloured a little at the implied compliment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are good to say so,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said lightly, &#8220;it is nothing. You are
a soldier; I am sure you are brave and true and
loyal, that you have a sense of duty. What is a
moment&#8217;s carelessness to set against that? There!
Perhaps I have said too much for the proprieties,
but I can&#8217;t bear to see you weighed down by unnecessary
self-reproach. Now you must go and
shoot away with a clear conscience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Respecting her motive for frankness, he only
gave her a grateful bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to shoot this morning,&#8221; he informed
her. &#8220;I have been lucky enough to find
a companion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; She turned quickly to him with a look
of something more than curiosity. &#8220;Here in
these wilds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly here,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;But in
Kulhausen last evening. An old friend of mine.
I am going now to fetch him over to my gipsy
camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A brother officer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, a civilian. His name is Horaz Galabin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
He is one of the secretaries in the Chancellor&#8217;s
Bureau.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke quite carelessly, as though his friend&#8217;s
identity were scarcely a matter to interest his companion,
and he was surprised to notice a rather
anxious look on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the world,&#8221; she asked&mdash;and he could
not help thinking her voice rather betrayed an unsuccessful
attempt at indifference&mdash;&#8220;is a secretary
of the Chancellerie doing out in these uncivilized
parts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He comes for sport, he tells me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! And you both by lucky chance find a
companion.&#8221; She had regained her self-possession
now. &#8220;Come! Here is another reason
why you need not regret that mistaken shot. If
you had not ridden into town for the doctor you
would not have met your friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>A chance which he had been hoping for had presented
itself, and he seized it.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had taken the Count&#8217;s horse,&#8221; he said with
a reminiscent laugh, &#8220;I should have got to Kulhausen
sooner, and thereby should have probably
missed Galabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; she agreed. &#8220;I am glad you did
not take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for that reason alone, Fr&auml;ulein?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment her eyes rested on him searchingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
as though to determine whether she might trust
him. Evidently the result of the scrutiny was
favourable, for she answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I did not want you to take the Count&#8217;s
horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gathered that,&#8221; he said with a smile; &#8220;and
I have been puzzled for a reason, which perhaps
I have no right to seek.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The explanation is quite simple,&#8221; she replied,
smiling now in her turn. &#8220;I did not wish the
Count detained here till you could bring his horse
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count,&#8221; he said, &#8220;did not seem to share
your idea that it would be inconvenient to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To him? Did I say so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, then to you. You do not like Count
Zarka?&#8221;</p>

<p>Without looking at him she gave a little impatient
shake of the head. &#8220;Not very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so yesterday.&#8221; The girl was silent.
&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I can guess why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is scarcely worth speculating about,&#8221; she
said with a touch of pride. &#8220;Ah, here is my
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herr Harlberg had sauntered from the house,
and now came towards them with a not particularly
gracious look on his discontented face. Von
Tressen paid his respects, explained the object of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
his call, and expressed his relief at the doctor&#8217;s
favourable report. Then, accepting a hint from
Harlberg&#8217;s manner that he had stayed long enough,
he took his leave.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Tell me about this Count Zarka,&#8221; Galabin asked
Von Tressen as they drove out to the forest together.
&#8220;A wonderful fellow, is he not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear man, I know little more than you.
He has at least a wonderful house. Why are you
so curious about the fellow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I have heard of him in town,&#8221; the other
answered carelessly. &#8220;He is reported to have become
rich in an astonishingly short time, and no
one can tell how.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has the reputation of being a great gambler,
and, what seldom follows, a successful one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you not believe it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin gave a shrug. &#8220;I have no grounds on
which to form an opinion. Yet I confess a man
may well be sceptical. The gambler&#8217;s trade hardly
pays so prodigiously&mdash;at least when he plays
fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>They soon reached Von Tressen&#8217;s encampment,
and after luncheon took their guns and strolled
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is all the same to you,&#8221; Galabin suggested,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
&#8220;suppose we shape our course in the direction of
the Schloss Rozsnyo. I am rather curious to see
the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, my friend,&#8221; Von Tressen returned
slily, &#8220;you are very anxious to see it, and are much
interested in Count Zarka. Why, I do not know.
To me he is not an attractive person.&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin gave a shrug. &#8220;I am a student of human
nature, my dear Osbert. This man is a curiosity.
At least you will allow that. Most men are negative
characters. I love a positive, whether it be
good or evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The positive characters in general are evil, are
they not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True. And I imagine our friend over there
in particular. Still he will be a study.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mark!&#8221; Von Tressen&#8217;s gun rang out, and a
black-cock fell twenty yards in front of them. &#8220;But,
my good Horaz,&#8221; he said as he reloaded, &#8220;you did
not come out here to study character. You came
for sport, did you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin pointed to the fallen bird. &#8220;There are
more kinds of sport than that, my friend,&#8221; he
returned.</p>

<p>Von Tressen looked at him sharply, and, as the
eyes of the two men met, the light of a mutual
understanding seemed to fill them. &#8220;Now, Horaz,&#8221;
he said with a laugh, &#8220;is it worth while wasting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
time by playing at cross purposes? We are old
comrades; you can trust me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied after a moment&#8217;s hesitation,
&#8220;I can trust you. We both serve the same master,
and it is on his business that I am here. Besides,
you should be able to help me; there is no reason
why we should not work together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;State service? My dear Horaz, you may be
sure I shall only be too ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We diplomats,&#8221; Galabin observed cautiously,
&#8220;have to be more than ordinarily careful. Gersdorff
would say it is a mistake to trust one&#8217;s dearest
friend. The very essence of our work is secrecy.
Still, confidence here is less dangerous than the
risk of our playing at cross purposes; for there,
my friend, you might easily and quite unwittingly
spoil my game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; Von Tressen agreed. &#8220;Nevertheless,
you must not take me into your confidence
against your better judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not. Still I feel sure you can help me
here if you will. It is a business where pluck and
nerve are likely to be needed. You will give me
your word of honour to be secret?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. You have my word of honour.
Beyond that, if, as I understand, it is a state affair,
and no private business, I am already bound by my
oath of service.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;Of course, my dear Osbert, I know you would
be loyal to the death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what is this mysterious undertaking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Principally to find out all about your friend at
Rozsnyo.&#8221;</p>

<p>Von Tressen laughed. &#8220;As I had already
guessed. He is suspect?&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin nodded. &#8220;There is an idea that he is
in the pay of Russia. And, incidentally that he
knows as much, or rather more, than anybody else
about the disappearance of Prince Roel of Rapsberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your mission is to convert the conjecture
into a certainty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely. Now, tell me what you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw himself down on the natural bank
which rose towards the trunk of a great pine, and
Von Tressen followed his example.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very little,&#8221; the Lieutenant replied. &#8220;And
about Count Zarka, except that I have made the
man&#8217;s acquaintance, probably much less than you.
My meeting him was the result of a rather curious
adventure yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Von Tressen thereupon related the story of his
unlucky shot, and his meeting with Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg,
telling everything with perfect frankness.
When he had come to an end Galabin remarked:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>&#8220;So you were not favourably impressed with the
Herr Graf, and the young lady shares your repugnance.
Harlberg? H&#8217;m! It is curious that an
elderly man should drag his daughter out to a
lonely farmhouse in these wilds for sport. You
have come across him in your shooting excursions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But I have been here only a few days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no corroborative evidence that he
does shoot?&#8221;</p>

<p>Von Tressen laughed. &#8220;No. Nor can I say
that he looks a keen sportsman. One thing I did
notice about him, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That he had the air of a military man?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Lieutenant stared. &#8220;Why, Horaz, how did
you guess that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall know before long. I have an idea.
These people are intimate with the Count, and mein
Herr comes here for sport. The Count, their friend,
has a great house quite near. Why does he not
invite them to stay at Rozsnyo instead of allowing
them to undergo the discomforts of an old farmhouse?&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed to be arguing the matter with himself
rather than putting the question to his companion.</p>

<p>Von Tressen shook his head. &#8220;It is very singular.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so very strange,&#8221; Galabin returned with
a laugh. &#8220;If you are an admirer of Fr&auml;ulein<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Harlberg, my dear friend, I dare say there is no
reason why you should not continue your admiration.&#8221;</p>

<p>Von Tressen was silent for a few moments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are they here?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! That is a question which perhaps no
one could answer so satisfactorily as Count Zarka.
But if we have patience we may find it out for ourselves.
At present I can only hazard the merest
guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the Count may share your and Prince
Roel&#8217;s admiration for the young lady. Is it too
improbable?&#8221;</p>

<p>Von Tressen shook his head resentfully. &#8220;No;
I fear it is quite likely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least it supplies a motive. I fancy Rozsnyo
is the central point of a very pretty series of conspiracies,
public and private, one within the other,
which it will be my task to unravel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall only be too glad to help you,&#8221; Von Tressen
declared heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then. We will make a reconnaissance
of Rozsnyo to-night.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE MYSTERY OF ROZSNYO</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> about nine o&#8217;clock that evening the two friends
set out through the forest for the Schloss Rozsnyo.
They had been careful to utter no hint of their
intention which might be overheard by Bela, Von
Tressen&#8217;s soldier servant, and their nocturnal expedition
was ostensibly to the feeding grounds of
the deer, which in those regions are stalked at night.</p>

<p>A cloudy sky with occasional bright intervals
suited their purpose well, and the forest paths had
become sufficiently familiar to Von Tressen to
enable him to guide his companion without difficulty
across the wooded valley to the elevation on which
Rozsnyo stood.</p>

<p>As they drew near the castle the moon shone out
brilliantly for a few minutes, affording them, from
their dark covert, a magnificent view of the romantic
building perched high above them. A curious
edifice blending, as it did, antique and modern styles
of architecture, the rough solidity of the ancient
fortified dwelling with the fantastic pretentiousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
of the Gothic of yesterday. But the whole effect
was picturesque enough, especially as seen by
moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fine lair for a beast of prey,&#8221; was Galabin&#8217;s
comment. &#8220;What if the inside should be as foul
as the outside is fair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not an easy place to reconnoitre,&#8221; Von Tressen
observed, having taken in with a professional
scrutiny the situation of the castle and its points
of approach.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Galabin replied; &#8220;the undertaking is by
no means easy or safe, as the Chancellor gave me
clearly to understand. Still, I mean to go through
with it, although there is no reason why one need
act with precipitation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keeping within the dark fringe of the wood, they
began the ascent of the hill and soon had reached
the small plateau on which Rozsnyo stood. As
the castle came into view from the side approach
the two men could get a very good idea of its real
size and form. It was a large rambling structure,
covering far more space than apparently its real
size and capacity would warrant. Indeed, the
idea in its construction seemed to have been distance;
for one part, that is, to lie as far from the
other extremity as possible. From their point of
observation in the valley below, the two men had
noticed a light in one of the windows; here on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
inner side all was dark: there seemed no sign of life
about the place.</p>

<p>The principal approach to the castle was by a
great bridge of wood and iron thrown over a moat
drained of its water and planted with flower-beds in
curiously modern contrast to the grey massive walls
which rose from it.</p>

<p>All was still and silent save for the rustling of the
pines as an occasional gust swept through them.
The two men emerged boldly into the open which
divided the surrounding wood from the castle
precincts.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are doing no harm in strolling round the
place,&#8221; Galabin said. &#8220;Let us make a tour of
inspection and keep our eyes open.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keeping on the outer edge of what had been the
moat, they followed the circuit of the building
until they came round again on the farther side of
the declivity of rock which dropped almost sheer
down to the valley. Nothing but a general idea
of the castle rewarded their scrutiny. All was dark
and silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a very promising place to investigate,&#8221;
Von Tressen laughed. &#8220;We had better go back
again as we came. To try and get down into the
valley from this side looks like breaking our necks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Galabin assented grimly. &#8220;The vulture
has well chosen his eyrie. But for a great house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
there seems to be a singular absence of life about
the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>A heavy bank of clouds had now drifted over the
moon, and the darkness, intensified by the wall of
pine woods, was so thick that the two men had
some difficulty in finding their way round the moat
again, at least without stumbling down the grass-grown
bank.</p>

<p>Suddenly Von Tressen, who was in front, stopped,
so abruptly that Galabin cannoned against him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>

<p>A ray of light had shot out across the moat at a
point some twenty yards in front of them. It came
from the castle, and was rendered more vivid by the
intense darkness elsewhere. The two diverged
from the path now until they came opposite to the
spot whence the light proceeded. It streamed
from a window at some distance from the ground
in an otherwise blank wall which connected two
Gothic towers. There was nothing, of course,
mysterious or even remarkable in the appearance
of the light, which was, indeed, rather to be expected
than the utter darkness in which all the back
part of the castle had been shrouded, yet somehow
both men felt that there was an element of mystery
about it. For one thing, the room whence it came
was situated at about the most distant point from
that other lighted window they had seen from below,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
while all the intervening block of buildings seemed
dark and silent as a ruin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like,&#8221; said Galabin, &#8220;to take the
liberty of looking inside that room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible, so far as one can see,&#8221; Von Tressen
replied. &#8220;There is nothing but sheer wall. Still,
we might creep across and examine it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Keeping well outside the band of light which
stretched slantwise across the moat, they descended
into its hollow and crept up the other side. So
much of it, that is, as they found practicable. For
the angle made by the inner bank only rose about
eight or ten feet from the bottom and then continued
in sheer, straight stone wall. The two men
were now directly underneath the window from
which the light passed high over their heads;
but, although they listened intently they could
detect no sound from the room above them. To
think of climbing the wall was absurd. At that
part, at any rate, the stones were smoothly laid and
faced, no hold for hands or feet was possible. After
a thorough examination both men agreed that it was
not feasible.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only some of yonder trees grew this side of the
moat,&#8221; Von Tressen observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; An idea occurred to his friend. &#8220;Suppose
we climb one as it is and try what we can see.
We shall at least get on a level with the window.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Von Tressen nodded, and they stealthily recrossed
the dip and regained the shelter of the wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go up and take an observation,&#8221; Von
Tressen proposed. &#8220;I used to be a good climber.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selecting the foremost tree opposite the window,
the Lieutenant with some little difficulty swarmed
up the bare trunk. Galabin stood below eagerly
watching his progress, which became easier as he
got higher and the stem grew narrower. At length
he calculated that Von Tressen must be on a level
with the window, and drew back to measure the
distance with his eye. As he did so, suddenly and
silently the light vanished. He turned quickly,
only to see nothing but a mass of black wall rising
indistinct in the darkness. It was some minutes
before he heard his companion descending; perhaps
he had lingered in the hope that the light might re-appear,
for assuredly nothing was to be seen in its
absence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just too late,&#8221; Von Tressen exclaimed regretfully,
as he reached the ground. &#8220;It was provoking;
but, never mind, we may have better luck
another night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; we will come to-morrow,&#8221; Galabin said.
&#8220;Although, after all, there may be nothing worth
troubling to see. But I must confess&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped as Von Tressen knocked his arm
sharply. An extraordinary thing had happened.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
For the moon coming out in its full brightness
showed the wall blank now, without a trace of the
window whence the light had shone.</p>

<p>At first neither man could realize it nor believe his
eyes. Then, as they became certain of the strange
disappearance they looked at each other in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where has the window gone to?&#8221; Von Tressen
exclaimed, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>Galabin shook his head. &#8220;Rather mysterious,
is it not? Let us cross over again and make sure
that it is not an optical delusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few seconds they were under the wall, looking
in vain for a sign of the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was directly above us here,&#8221; Von Tressen said.
&#8220;I would swear to that. I marked it by the triangular
flower-bed. But where is it now?&#8221;</p>

<p>The dark wall above them presented an unbroken
surface of stone. The moon shone out for a
moment and proved it clearly. There was no window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; observed Galabin, as they turned away
from their puzzled search, &#8220;at least we have found
something mysteriously interesting to follow up.
Count Zarka is evidently a man worth the trouble
of watching. We will come again to-morrow night,
and may have better luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>So without seeing anything further to excite their
curiosity they returned through the forest to their
camping-ground.</p>

<small>ZARKA PLAYS TERRORIST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day, as the two friends were preparing for
a morning&#8217;s sport, they were surprised by a visit
from no less a personage than Count Zarka himself.
He came in, all smiles, to invite them to Rozsnyo.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really cannot allow you to live here like
gipsies,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when I have a great, almost
empty house, within a stone&#8217;s throw. You must
be my guests while you stay in the forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>His manner was polished and civil to a degree
which with some people would have seemed charming,
yet somehow to the two men it was in the
matter of sincerity absolutely unconvincing. The
invitation was declined as gracefully as possible,
but without hesitation. They liked the free life
of the forest, Von Tressen said, the novel change
in their mode of existence. Moreover, they were
not prepared for visiting, and would feel uncomfortable
in a big house.</p>

<p>Zarka forebore to press the invitation beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
the slight combating of their excuses which the
appearance of sincerity demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least,&#8221; he said with his somewhat sinister
smile, &#8220;you must let me make you free of that part
of the forest which is my preserve. I can promise
you good sport there.&#8221;</p>

<p>They thanked him and could not well refuse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;if you will not stay at
my somewhat formidable house, you will at least
not refuse to come and see it. You have doubtless
an hour to spare this afternoon. I have some
curiosities which may interest you, and the view
from my Belvidere is magnificent. I may expect
you? Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Von Tressen glanced at Galabin, who, without
hesitation, accepted the invitation. Whereupon
with a parting volley of polite remarks and small-talk
the Count wheeled his horse and with a flourish
rode off.</p>

<p>&#8220;An interesting specimen of character,&#8221; Galabin
observed as they stood watching him down the
forest road. &#8220;I wonder why he wanted us to stay
at Rozsnyo; that is, if he did want us, which I
doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment the Count turned in his saddle
and, looking back, saw they were watching him.
He waved his riding whip. It was a mere flourish
to cover his action of curiosity, and as such the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
men recognized it. Then he put his horse to a trot
and was quickly out of sight. The two looked at
each other and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad, anyhow, he asked us up there,&#8221;
Galabin said. &#8220;I want to take every opportunity
I can get of examining the place. And I have a
curiosity to see what our mysterious window looks
like by daylight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Count Zarka rode on to Gorla&#8217;s Farm and announced
himself with, for a ceremonious person,
scant ceremony to Philippa Harlberg, whom he
found in the house. Perhaps he had an idea that
a more formal entry might result in his not seeing
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father is smoking his cigar outside,&#8221; she
said, as they shook hands.</p>

<p>He returned a protesting smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not come particularly to see the General.
I came to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her reception of the announcement was hardly
encouraging, yet she had to submit to the visit
with as good a grace as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had news to-day from town,&#8221; he observed;
then stopped, watching her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes?&#8221; There was repressed apprehension
in her tone which he was too clever to fail to notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prince Roel has not yet been found&mdash;dead or
alive.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>&#8220;Poor fellow!&#8221; Her pity was genuine enough,
yet there was something behind it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The search,&#8221; Zarka continued, still eyeing her
keenly, &#8220;is being energetically carried on by his
family as well as by the Government. It is just
as well that you did not stay in the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She responded mechanically without
conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great friend of Prince Roel&#8217;s is reported to
have set out for Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; She looked at him enquiringly, yet
unwilling to show how great her curiosity was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he proceeded with his evil smile. &#8220;Perhaps
after all you may have been very wise in changing
your intention of going to Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she agreed in the same preoccupied
tone. Then with a flash her manner changed.
&#8220;No. I was wrong to leave town. You should
know perfectly well, Count, that I was neither
directly nor indirectly the cause of Prince Roel&#8217;s
disappearance.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke vehemently, as though lashed by the
man&#8217;s insinuations into taking a stand against
him. He merely smiled, more inscrutably than
ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course if you will tell me so I am bound to
believe it,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Only, other people might
not be so easily convinced.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>&#8220;And why not, pray?&#8221; she demanded, with a
touch of haughtiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince was well known to be rather more
than an admirer of yours, Fr&auml;ulein.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absurd!&#8221; she burst out. &#8220;An admirer, perhaps,
but nothing more, and you have no warrant
for supposing such a thing. Do men make away
with themselves for unreturned admiration? I
am not to be at the mercy of such a suggestion,
Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>Behind the tolerant smile of a strong-willed
man who holds, or thinks he holds, a winning card,
there was a look of intense, hardly disguised admiration
in Zarka&#8217;s eyes. The girl had at last
roused herself to face him; instead of mere avoidance
she had sounded now a bold note of open
defiance. He realized that, perhaps he had expected
it, anyhow he was prepared to meet it.</p>

<p>He replied quietly, veiling the sentiment her
outburst had called up&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is most unfair,&#8221; he said insinuatingly, &#8220;that
you should be the victim of an unfortunate suspicion;
particularly hard that the crime of which
you stand accused is simply that of exciting in this
man an admiration which you were unable to
return. My dear Fr&auml;ulein, it must often have been
your fate&mdash;and will be&mdash;to commit that offence,
if it be one.&#8221; As she was not looking at him, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
saved himself the trouble of pointing his compliment
with one of his characteristic smiles. &#8220;But
in this case,&#8221; he went on suavely&mdash;&#8220;you will, I am
sure, forgive my hinting at it&mdash;have not Prince
Roel&#8217;s friends perhaps something more to go upon
than a mere suggestion?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned upon him sharply, and met the insinuating
smile she so detested.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Count?&#8221;</p>

<p>He spread out his hands deprecatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; he continued in the same quiet voice,
subdued because the words themselves carried
sting and point sufficient, &#8220;have they not evidence
of a pre-determination on the Prince&#8217;s part not to
survive your cruelty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My cruelty!&#8221; she cried, and her face went white.
&#8220;What evidence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The evidence,&#8221; he answered quietly and unhesitatingly,
&#8220;of the roses.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was at a loss, that was plain. And the idea
of a false underhand accusation struck more fear
to her than the certainty of her visitor&#8217;s determined
persecution.</p>

<p>&#8220;The roses?&#8221; she repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The red and the white,&#8221; he answered, with an
almost mocking seriousness. &#8220;The white signifying
life, and the red, death. It was perhaps a cruel
choice to force upon you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;Choice?&#8221; she exclaimed in blank amazement.
&#8220;I know of no choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely!&#8221; he insisted blandly. &#8220;And you wore
the red roses at the Margravine von Reuspach&#8217;s ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wore&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Yes, I remember
wearing red roses which Prince Roel sent me. I
hesitated whether I should put them in my dress,
and only did so because I thought it would be ungracious
to refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka raised his eyebrows in affected astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ungracious, Fr&auml;ulein? To refuse to send your
lover to his death?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prince Roel was not my lover,&#8221; she retorted
indignantly. &#8220;And how could wearing his roses
send him to his death?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The red ones, Fr&auml;ulein,&#8221; he answered with
suave insistence. &#8220;The red were for death, the white
for life. And you chose to wear the red.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl looked at him half in doubt, half in
consternation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing of any white roses,&#8221; she replied
steadily, although her heart began to be full of a
sickening fear of treachery, &#8220;nor of any particular
significance attached to my wearing red ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count looked incredulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed! But Prince Roel is known to have
sent roses of both kinds, with a note intimating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
the significance to turn of which colour you should
choose to wear that night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing of this. All I received was a
bunch of red roses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And no note?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And no note. Perhaps, Count,&#8221; she went on,
with a touch of scorn, &#8220;as you know so much more
of the affair than I, you will tell me the words of the
note.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka gave a slight bow of acceptance.</p>

<p>&#8220;A copy of the note addressed to you is in the
hands of the Chancellor, as having been found
among Prince Roel&#8217;s papers,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I
have, as you know, had to interest myself in the
matter from political reasons. So far as my memory
serves me, the words were these:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I send you herewith two bunches of roses,
white and red; the white signify love and life;
the red, hate and death. Those which you will
wear to-night must decide my fate. R.&#8217; Those,&#8221;
he added with a smile, which seemed to deprecate
further denial on her part, &#8220;were the words. And
you wore the red roses.&#8221;</p>

<p>She met his look and replied, unfalteringly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count, I can only repeat I never got the note
you speak of, nor the white roses. You, who seem
to know so much, should at least know that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>Her manner was one of defiance rather than defence
or explanation, and Zarka felt that intimidation
here would hardly serve his purpose. Accordingly
he changed his tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad to hear it,&#8221; he said sympathetically,
&#8220;and more especially for your own sake.
But it seems to me that some hideous mistake has
been made, possibly by an enemy of the Prince&#8217;s,
a mistake which is likely to have cost him his life.
It strikes, as I have hinted, a particularly cruel
blow at you, Fr&auml;ulein. For the world will hardly
believe that you wore the red roses by accident, not
design. And&mdash;I do not wish to alarm you, but it
is necessary to realize and face the situation&mdash;the
effect on the Prince&#8217;s family and friends must be
bitter enough to lead to danger to yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger!&#8221; the girl echoed scornfully. &#8220;I
am not afraid, knowing that I have done nothing
to deserve their ill-feeling. What do you mean by
danger, Count? It is, as you say, best to know
how one stands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka affected to hesitate, as shrinking from a
truth which might alarm her.</p>

<p>&#8220;These Eastern Huns,&#8221; he replied slowly and
with an assumed deliberation, &#8220;are a peculiar
race, given to fits of ungovernable passion, and
actuated by a blind spirit of revenge for a wrong,
fancied or real. They are dangerous people to cross,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
hot-headed and unreasoning, and there is no knowing
to what length their vindictiveness may carry
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand your suggestion,&#8221; the girl said
almost coldly. &#8220;Do these people wreak their
vengeance on women? I always thought they
were chivalrous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka&#8217;s eyes were fixed on her like those of a
snake, ever ready to dart in the direction his prey
might try to escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have never heard,&#8221; he replied, almost
softly, &#8220;of the Blutrache, the blood vengeance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A kind of vendetta,&#8221; she replied, in a tone
approaching indifference. &#8220;Yes. But you will hardly
expect me to stand in terror of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he returned. &#8220;Then you know little
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I knew everything I should not fear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, Fr&auml;ulein?&#8221; His exclamation was an
incredulous protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. For two reasons,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;In
the first place, I am entirely innocent of Prince
Roel&#8217;s death, and in the second, even did it lie at
my door, I can hardly suppose that the most blood-thirsty
of his avengers would seek retribution
against a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka gave a shrug of doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not. Although I have never heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
that these people allowed the sex of their wronger
to stand in the way of their vengeance. What I
wish to say, Fr&auml;ulein,&#8221; he continued with a change
of tone, &#8220;is, that I hope I shall be permitted to
stand between you and any danger which may
exist. Let me assure you of my devotion both to
your safety and happiness as to yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke earnestly, with a touch of repressed
passion in his voice. Before she could reply, to
her great relief her father came in, and no more on
the subject could be said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>THE CASTLE BY DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> afternoon, as arranged, Von Tressen and
Galabin paid a visit to Rozsnyo. Count Zarka
received them with every sign of hospitality, and
led them through a wide corridor lined with statues
and bronzes, to an octagonal belvidere room where,
somewhat to the visitors&#8217; surprise, they found two
ladies. The Count presented them to his cousin,
Madame d&#8217;Ivady, a stately, picturesque woman,
and her daughter, Fr&auml;ulein Royda, a dark, rather
handsome girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;My cousins,&#8221; Zarka said, with his easy, tactful,
man-of-the-world air, &#8220;are kind enough to take
compassion on my loneliness in this rocky stronghold,
and give me as much of their company here
as my conscience will allow me to take, knowing as
I do that I am thereby depriving them of the joys
of the outer world of gaiety and fashion, and that
world of their presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The elder lady swept her hand towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
windows which filled nearly three-quarters of the
side of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have at least nothing like this in Paris or
Vienna,&#8221; she said with a sort of stately patronage,
which made the two visitors struggle with a smile.</p>

<p>Perhaps the girl noticed their repressed amusement,
for she moved to the window, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where in the whole of Europe
another view like this is to be found. Is it not
magnificent?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her head in invitation to the young
men to join her, and they moved to her side. There
was no gainsaying the paramount loveliness of
the panorama beneath and around them; the
multitudinous shades of colour, ranging from the
purple black of the pine woods to the red gold of
the mountain tops; the spray of the torrent catching
the sunlight, the deep glassy mirror of the lake,
the luscious, restful green of the valley, and the
brilliant flower-clad bank from which the castle
rose&mdash;all made it indeed a position of surpassing
beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before we go over the place,&#8221; Zarka said, &#8220;you
must have some refreshment. Walking in the
forest is so fascinating that one is apt to forget how
exhausting it may be. Now you shall try some
Imperial Tokay.&#8221;</p>

<p>A large salver with cakes and flasks of wine had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
been brought in, and Zarka did the honours with
a flourish and excess of politeness which hardly
left room for the suspicion of a grim nature beneath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried to persuade our friends to take up their
abode here for a while,&#8221; he observed to the ladies.
&#8220;But they preferred the simplicity of a tent in the
forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More natural than gallant,&#8221; Madame d&#8217;Ivady
commented, in her grand manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly ungallant,&#8221; Galabin objected laughingly,
&#8220;since we did not know of the presence of ladies at
Rozsnyo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now you are aware of it,&#8221; the old lady said
with the same pompous rigidity, &#8220;will you not
change your mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not worry our young friends, Cousin
Gertrud. It is only natural that they should like
the free life of the forest, and it would be unfair to
make them lead, even here, the very existence
from which they have for the time emancipated
themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother can hardly understand any one preferring
life in a tent to being snug in a house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Certainly the imagination would fail to picture
the majestic, formal Madame d&#8217;Ivady roughing it
under canvas, and they smiled at the idea.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>&#8220;Now,&#8221; exclaimed Zarka, as having finally disposed
of the subject, &#8220;shall we stroll round and see
the few curiosities my poor house has to show?
Come, Royda. I suppose we cannot tempt you,
Cousin Gertrud?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady excused herself with a dignity out
of all proportion to the matter, and they went off
on a tour of inspection, the host leading the way,
and keeping up a running description of the place
as they proceeded, explaining how he had, so to
speak, grafted a new house on the remains of the
medi&aelig;val castle. All the rooms through which
they passed were decorated and furnished in a
manner suggestive of considerable wealth.</p>

<p>Presently they crossed a small inner courtyard,
and Zarka paused before a door of ecclesiastical
design.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is a necessary adjunct to a house
so isolated as mine.&#8221; He threw open the door, and
they found themselves to their surprise in an elaborately
fitted private chapel. It was perhaps as
well that their voluble host did not catch the glances
exchanged between his two visitors; he might not
have felt flattered by the implied sarcasm on his
religious arrangements. Perhaps their silence was
significant; anyhow the Count did not detain them
in the chapel longer than was needed to glance
round it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, as they turned from the door,
&#8220;one more room, and I will not bore you by playing
the showman any longer, at least indoors. I must
take you down into the rock and show you my
armoury. I think you will admit it is worth seeing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed it was. The Count led the way down a
broad winding staircase cut between walls of solid
rock. Deep loopholes, lined with reflectors, gave
light at intervals, and the roughness of the steps,
evidently hewn in the rock-bed, was covered with
thick carpets of Oriental design. Arrived at the
bottom the Count pressed a knob, and the great
barred doors in front of them opened, disclosing an
unexpected sight.</p>

<p>It was a great room, constructed deep in the rock;
its stone walls, hewn smooth and polished, were
hung with arms and trophies of the chase. Suits
of armour of various descriptions and ages were
arranged on stands round the room, from regal
suits of mail to the habergeons of humble pikemen
and arquebusiers. Above were suspended helmets,
the crested, gold-inlaid casques of warrior kings and
knights, as well as the sallet of the free-lance and
the plain skull pieces and morions of foot-soldiers.
Shields of various shapes and emblazonry formed a
frieze round the upper part of the walls; below
were swords, rapiers and daggers, lances gay with
pennons, murderous pikes, daggers, gauntlets, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
in artistic array. The great room, hewn out almost
to the face of the rock, sloping almost sheer
down from beneath the castle, was lighted by deep
windows opening on to the side of the precipice, and
commanding the sunlit valley which stretched away
below.</p>

<p>Zarka watched his visitors&#8217; surprise with his habitual
smile, a smile which seemed to serve as a mask
for possibly darker thoughts behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;This room,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;is my favourite toy,
and it has afforded me more amusement than most
toys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An innocent amusement,&#8221; Galabin thought;
&#8220;yet, truly with a grim significance behind it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The room was made before my time,&#8221; Zarka
continued, in answer to a question of Von Tressen&#8217;s.
&#8220;It was excavated by my great-grandfather and
used as a sort of strong room; perhaps&#8221;&mdash;he gave
a shrug&mdash;&#8220;who knows? a hiding place in those
troublous times. All I have done is to have it
enlarged and fitted up as you see. Yes; it is my
hobby. I have fallen a prey to the collector&#8217;s
mania, and I fear have wasted much time and good
money over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently, when they had gone round the room,
and cursorily inspected its contents, their host proposed,
what his visitors were really eager for, a
stroll round the outside of the castle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>&#8220;You have a most interesting abode,&#8221; Galabin
remarked, as they found themselves in the hall
again. &#8220;I suppose there are further curiosities to
be seen above stairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count&#8217;s urbane smile widened into a half
comic grin of apology.</p>

<p>&#8220;All modern! Alas! all modern,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;The lower part of the castle alone is
old. I will not destroy the effect of the few quaint
things you have seen by contrasting them with the
bedroom appointments from the K&ouml;nigstrasse.
Unless, that is, you shall change your mind and
care to spend a few nights here. Perhaps if the
weather breaks I may have the pleasure of being
your host.&#8221;</p>

<p>They strolled out and made the circuit of the
castle. It was with no small curiosity that the two
visitors sought the window where they had seen the
light, and which had seemed to disappear so mysteriously.
It had vanished indeed. A blank wall
ran from tower to tower without an opening or
break of any kind. Unseen by Zarka the two men
exchanged glances of wonder. Surely, they thought,
the window itself with the light streaming from it
across to the very spot where they were standing
had not been a delusion of their brain. At any rate,
now in the broad sunlight, there was no sign of it
to be detected. The wall, massive and thick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
seemed to put out of the question the idea of an
opening into it. No particular examination could,
of course, be hazarded, but a glance was enough to
show how unaccountable was what they had seen
the night before.</p>

<p>As they strolled on, Fr&auml;ulein d&#8217;Ivady lingered
behind to point out to Von Tressen a rare species
of flowering plant which was growing in the old
moat. This man&#339;uvre, for it seemed designed,
threw them a little way behind the other pair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been long encamped here in the
forest?&#8221; the girl asked as they turned to follow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard,&#8221; she seemed to lower her voice guardedly,
&#8220;I heard of your adventure the other day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My adventure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely!&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;The rare game you
flushed and hit. The mysterious lady who has
taken up her abode at the old farmhouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes. That was an unfortunate mistake of
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me of this Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg,&#8221; she said
quickly. &#8220;I have never seen her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have only seen her twice,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;and
know nothing about her except that she is staying
there with her father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For sport, I understood. But I am sure the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
Count could tell you far more about them than
I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aubray?&#8221; She nodded at Zarka. &#8220;He is
there often? He knows them very well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; Von Tressen answered. &#8220;He
seemed the other day on quite familiar terms with
them. I imagined they were old friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was a simple, straight-forward fellow, Von
Tressen, and innocently saw nothing beyond curiosity
in his companion&#8217;s questions. Perhaps,
though, had he looked in her face during his last
words he might have realized that there was something
more serious in those almost breathless
inquiries.</p>

<p>&#8220;This Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg,&#8221; she went on; &#8220;is
she very handsome?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; very good-looking, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated a little awkwardly over his answer,
and, woman-like, she instantly divined the reason.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she returned, with an affectation of banter
in her tone, &#8220;I understand, do I? The romance
is not to end with the healing of the lady&#8217;s wounded
hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go too fast for me, Fr&auml;ulein.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least you are interested in&mdash;your victim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I be otherwise? Still I regret that my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
knowledge is not equal to my interest, or I could
better gratify your curiosity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Curiosity about what?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count had turned suddenly&mdash;he evidently
vibrated with alertness and had quick ears. The
restless, glittering eyes and wolfish teeth faced
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curiosity about what?&#8221; he repeated, as each
hesitated for the other to reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, Aubray,&#8221; the girl answered quickly,
as though to anticipate Von Tressen. &#8220;I was
asking the Lieutenant about his adventures in the
forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The eyes fixed on them seemed to grow stern,
although the smile did not relax.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the Lieutenant had any adventures, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing worth relating,&#8221; Von Tressen answered.
Somehow he felt he did not care to allude
to the one episode the girl and he had been speaking
of.</p>

<p>Zarka&#8217;s grin widened as his eyes looked more
insistent. &#8220;What is the mystery?&#8221; he demanded,
addressing his cousin rather than Von Tressen.</p>

<p>&#8220;No mystery, Aubray,&#8221; she replied, with a little
show of impatience, &#8220;but what you already know.
Lieutenant Von Tressen&#8217;s unlucky shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah? You do not deserve to hear tales if you
allude to them so indiscreetly, my good cousin.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>He spoke playfully, but there was an evil gleam
in his eyes. The girl bit her lip in self-annoyance,
and said nothing. Von Tressen interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can assure you, Count, that so far as I am
concerned, there was no reason why Fr&auml;ulein d&#8217;Ivady
should not allude to that unlucky episode. At
least I deserve to be for ever reminded of my carelessness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka made a gesture of protest. &#8220;You are my
guest, Herr Lieutenant, and I do not wish you,
here, at any rate, to be twitted with a mistake
which might have had very serious consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to Von Tressen that his host was making
much more of the business than had the girl. There
was a scarcely veiled sharpness in Zarka&#8217;s tone which
seemed meant to sting his cousin.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I assure you, Count&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Von Tressen
began, when Zarka interrupted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us dismiss the subject, please,&#8221; he said
almost peremptorily. &#8220;It is happily at an end.&#8221;</p>

<small>A TELL-TALE LIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I cannot</span> make out our friend the Count,&#8221; Galabin
observed, as the two walked back to their temporary
home. &#8220;The whole business is a puzzle, but I must
say an interesting one, and I am not sorry for
having set myself to unriddle it. He is sharp and
clever&mdash;unpleasantly so&mdash;but I do not think he has
any idea that I am here less for sport than to keep
an eye on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Von Tressen agreed. &#8220;I could have
kicked the fellow, though, for the bullying suggestion
in the way he spoke to that girl. I fancy,
by the way, one of the hardest riddles you have to
solve, my friend, is whence he, lately a poor man,
has got all the money of which that place gives
evidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; the Herr Count is interesting game to
stalk, and not easy. But a slight chance may show
us a way of coming close to him and getting in a
shot. We must go back there to-night for a further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
examination of that mysterious window. You&#8217;ll
come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Decidedly. I shall not rest till I have found
out at least that secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they got to the tent it was already dusk,
and they found Von Tressen&#8217;s man Bela lamenting
an over-cooked dinner. During the meal their talk
was guardedly of a simpler kind of sport than they
were in reality pursuing. Presently Bela, who was
waiting on them, observed&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is another gentleman shooting in this
part of the forest. Yes,&#8221; he went on, in answer to
their exclamation of surprise, &#8220;he passed by here
this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Harlberg, no doubt,&#8221; Von Tressen said to
Galabin. Then to Bela: &#8220;A short, elderly, gentleman,
with a military air, was it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man shook his head. &#8220;Military, perhaps,&#8221;
he replied. &#8220;But not old or short; he was tall
and fierce looking, with black eyes that looked
through one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men glanced at one another. &#8220;Who
can this be? A sportsman, you say, Bela?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mein Herr; he had a sporting gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the stranger&#8217;s identity was a puzzle. &#8220;After
all,&#8221; Von Tressen said at length, &#8220;we have no
monopoly of the forest; it is open to all as to us.
There may be other sportsmen about.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>Darkness having fallen by the time the meal was
over, they lighted their cigars and strolled off
again towards Rozsnyo. The sky had become
cloudy and threatened rain; it was, however, a
night well suited to their purpose. This time they
made their way directly to that side of the castle
where they had seen the mysteriously lighted
window. No; not a trace of it was to be noticed;
the wall was dark and presented the blank, unbroken
surface they had seen there in the afternoon. Even
in the darkness an unlighted window could not have
escaped their scrutiny, and there certainly was none.
They had the bearings exactly from the tree which
Von Tressen had climbed; but opposite to it now
was nothing but bare wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot understand it,&#8221; Galabin said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could we have made a mistake about the light?&#8221;
Von Tressen suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both of us? Impossible! And yet&mdash;ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was looking towards the spot as he spoke,
and now, breaking off suddenly, clutched his companion&#8217;s
arm. The Lieutenant turned eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked, after looking in the
direction for a few moments. &#8220;I can see nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait! Watch!&#8221; Galabin returned in an excited
whisper. &#8220;There! Look! Above the wall,&#8221;
he continued as Von Tressen made no response.
&#8220;There! again!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>&#8220;It was nothing but a bird flying over&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a bird. You saw it plainly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For how long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a second.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why no longer?&#8221; Galabin asked, with the
triumphant satisfaction bred of a discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bird was lost in the darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet it flew nearer to us. Ah, there is the
same thing again! How did we see it at all, my
friend? I&#8217;ll tell you. The bird was attracted by
and flew over a light. A vertical shaft of light
this time; not strong enough to be apparent of itself
from here, and only to be detected by the evidence
of an object passing through it. Now, watch
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>They remained intently looking for a few seconds
when the phenomenon was repeated. A large bird
became suddenly visible for an instant out of the
darkness and then disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now are you satisfied, my good friend?&#8221;
Galabin asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly. And the light&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must come from a skylight. There is a room
below there. And if a room, why not a concealed
window? though how contrived in that thick stone
wall, I cannot tell. At the same time that is to me
less interesting than to discover what the room is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
used for, who inhabits it, since it clearly is inhabited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could only get up there and look down,&#8221;
Von Tressen said. &#8220;But it hardly seems possible,
at least from this point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; his friend agreed. &#8220;Our only chance will
be to scale the wall at some place farther along if
we can find one practicable, and so make our way
to where the light shines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; Von Tressen said; &#8220;let us set about
finding a likely place. Who knows what discovery
may be in store for us? It is an altogether unjustifiable
liberty we are taking with our friend
the Count&#8217;s domestic arrangements, but State
service must over-ride that consideration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may take my word for that,&#8221; Galabin replied.
&#8220;The Chancellor would blame us if, having
seen this much, we were to neglect to find the
explanation. In these secret services the authority
cannot give explicit instructions; nearly everything
must be left to one&#8217;s own discretion and
enterprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cautiously they crossed the disused moat, and
began a close inspection of the walls in search of a
place where a climb might be feasible. They had
not proceeded far when Von Tressen turned and
held up his hand with a warning gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hist! I thought I heard something,&#8221; he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
under his breath. &#8220;It sounded like a man&#8217;s footstep
in the wood.&#8221;</p>

<p>They listened intently, the stillness preceding
the threatened storm making it easy to hear a very
slight sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; ejaculated Von Tressen, in scarcely a
whisper.</p>

<p>Now from the other side of the moat came distinctly
a slight cracking noise of footsteps on the
twigs and dead leaves that carpeted the wood. They
strained their eyes in the direction of the sound,
but could make out nothing. The person, whoever
it was, seemed to be stopping and then moving on,
for the footsteps would cease for a time and then be
heard again. Presently they could just see a black
figure moving against the dark background of trees
at the edge of the wood. Then it seemed to come
boldly forward, and stood out in the open space
between the trees and the moat. A man evidently,
a tall man; that was all they could discern. He
remained there for a while motionless as the two,
who watched him with intense curiosity. Soon he
moved and began to walk slowly along the edge of
the moat, as though making the circuit of the house.
The two men looked after him until he disappeared
in the darkness, then Galabin said in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we had better abandon our attempt for
to-night. I do not know who our friend may be;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
one of Zarka&#8217;s men on the watch, most likely. Anyhow,
it will not do for us to be caught. The sooner
we get across the wood the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He evidently did not suspect we were here,&#8221;
Von Tressen said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; and should we be seen it will be less suspicions
if we are found over there than here under
the wall. Now, as quietly as we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>They crept for a short distance round by the wall
in the opposite direction to that which the man had
taken. Then, stooping, they ran across the moat
and gained the shelter of the wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to see what that fellow&#8217;s game is,&#8221;
Galabin said, as they halted under cover of the trees.
&#8220;After all, we are doing no harm here, and have a
right to an evening stroll even in the precincts of our
friend Count Zarka&#8217;s stronghold.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly they began to move slowly and alertly
after the man. They had not gone far when they
stopped simultaneously, for his figure had suddenly
appeared out of the darkness a few yards in front
of them. Luckily he was just outside the edge of
the wood, they just within, consequently he was
much more easily visible to them than they to him.
The two friends stood still, pressed close against a
tree. Evidently the man had no idea of their
presence, for he passed slowly on without any sign
of suspicion, and they could hear his footsteps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
until he had gone some distance. Then Galabin
touched his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you make him out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly. Could you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I know something,&#8221; Galabin answered.
&#8220;It is the fellow your man saw passing the tent this
afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<small>ZARKA ON THE ALERT</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I am</span> going,&#8221; said Von Tressen to his friend next
morning, &#8220;up to the farm to ask Herr Harlberg
to shoot with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin laughed. &#8220;And the Fr&auml;ulein?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would only be polite,&#8221; the Lieutenant
replied in the same tone, &#8220;to make a point of enquiring
whether her hand is healed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! You can do no less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will come, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be in the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! You don&#8217;t want to rouse suspicion
by making yourself mysterious.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they set out together for the farm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if we shall come across our friend of last
night,&#8221; Von Tressen observed, for while the servant,
Bela, had been near they had not spoken on the
subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; Galabin replied thoughtfully. &#8220;I have
been thinking it over, and have come to the conclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
that the fellow is a patrol, a spy of Zarka&#8217;s.
What else could he have been prowling about
for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That might be said of us. We were doing the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True. But it is hardly likely that another man
would have the same purpose as ourselves. No;
the other solution is far more probable. Now, what
does Count Zarka, ostensibly a rich nobleman living
on his country estate, want with a patrol, or a
spy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Von Tressen shook his head. &#8220;The Count is
deeper than I can fathom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or I. We must wait for eventualities, and
meanwhile keep our eyes open.&#8221;</p>

<p>They soon reached the farm, and found father
and daughter in the little enclosed shrubbery before
the house. Herr Harlberg excused himself from
joining their sport on the plea of a gouty foot, but
welcomed his visitors and insisted upon their drinking
a glass of wine with him. Presently Von Tressen
found himself strolling with Philippa Harlberg in
the half-cleared woodland which surrounded the old
farm, Galabin, with an eye to the situation, having
plunged deep into a political argument with his
host.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have found another friend to join your
gipsy life,&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;The attractions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
forest must be great indeed, or is it the charm of
friendship?&#8221; she added banteringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The charm of the forest life is delightful,&#8221; Von
Tressen replied. &#8220;One cannot wonder at its being
an all-powerful attraction. If my friend only enjoys
it half as much as I he will not repent having cut
himself off for a time from cities and civilization.
I am so glad, Fr&auml;ulein, that the hand is well
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She held it out. &#8220;Yes; quite healed. Look.
Already scarcely a mark to be seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took it, and by an impulse, natural enough,
raised and pressed it to his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;All&#8217;s well that ends well,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Ah,
I hate myself for having hurt you, Fr&auml;ulein.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she withdrew her hand their eyes met. It
gave him a thrill of delight to see there was no anger
or offence in hers, only a touch of restraining sadness.
She gave a little sigh as she replied, hardly
above a whisper: &#8220;If no one might ever hurt me
more than that!&#8221;</p>

<p>To his chivalrous nature her words were as a
call to arms, for there was manifestly something
behind them. &#8220;Who would dare to harm you,
Fr&auml;ulein?&#8221;</p>

<p>With an effort, it seemed, she recovered her
gaiety. &#8220;Who, indeed,&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;would be
so unmanly? I only meant to tell you how lightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
I regard that little wound.&#8221; But she had meant
more than that, he was sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the same, if the unchivalrous man should
ever cross your path,&#8221; he said with a touch of
youthful romance in his tone, &#8220;I only hope it may
be my privilege to be there to defend you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed again. &#8220;Perhaps you may be. Who
knows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend and I were at Rozsnyo yesterday,&#8221;
he observed, following the train of thought suggested
to his mind by her words.</p>

<p>She turned quickly in surprise. &#8220;You went to
Rozsnyo?&#8221; He nodded. &#8220;At the Count&#8217;s invitation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At his pressing invitation. Is that strange?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. Why should it be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seemed surprised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Perhaps&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221; she stopped in some confusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Count is a peculiar man, you meant,
perhaps?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may know him now as well as I,&#8221; she
returned with a forced smile. The mention of
Zarka seemed to chill her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know him at all well,&#8221; he rejoined.
&#8220;I should much like to know him better.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started in apprehensive surprise. &#8220;To know
him better? Count Zarka?&#8221; she repeated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;For there seems a
mystery about the man which, between ourselves,
Fr&auml;ulein, I should like to solve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no!&#8221; She glanced round instinctively,
as though in fear that the man they spoke of might
be lurking near them. Then as she turned again
to her companion, he saw in her eyes a look of dread
which did not tend to mitigate the feelings he entertained
towards the lord of Rozsnyo.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better not be curious about Count
Zarka,&#8221; and as she spoke the name she lowered
her tone almost to a whisper. &#8220;He is a dangerous
man and, I fear, unscrupulous. You will only bring
harm on yourself by seeking to know too much of
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The feeling of terror with which Zarka had evidently
inspired her roused the young soldier&#8217;s
indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not afraid of Count Zarka,&#8221; he returned
boldly, &#8220;and I hope I never shall be. You may
trust me, Fr&auml;ulein, to take care of myself&mdash;and
you,&#8221; he added tenderly, &#8220;if you will let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She coloured a little. &#8220;I am sure I could trust
you,&#8221; she said softly. &#8220;But I hope,&#8221; she added
with more vivacity, &#8220;there will be no need for me
to enlist you as my defender.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even against Count Zarka?&#8221; he asked
searchingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>She met his eyes unfalteringly now. &#8220;Not
even against him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear it,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;for I
had an uncomfortable idea in my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray what was that?&#8221; She seemed quite to
have regained command over herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have of course,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;as a comparative
stranger no right to interfere or show curiosity
in the matter. Still, I could not help fancying that
the Count persecuted you. Am I right or
wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment she looked serious, then she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly right, Herr Lieutenant; and if you were,
why, a woman can usually protect herself from
persecution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When the man is dangerous and unscrupulous?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, perhaps that is different. But my case is
scarcely as bad as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear it,&#8221; he said gravely. &#8220;Will
you pardon one question, Fr&auml;ulein? It is, perhaps,
impertinent, but you need not answer it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This Count Zarka&mdash;is there any warrant for
his pretension? Is he your lover?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was looking away, perhaps half anticipating
what he would ask. For a moment or two she did
not reply, then without turning she said in a low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
voice: &#8220;My lover? No. He never could be
that&mdash;with my consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Von Tressen&#8217;s face brightened. &#8220;I am glad,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;for I feared.&#8221;</p>

<p>The path had led them back to the house, and in
another moment would bring them in sight of the
two men whom they could hear chatting in front
of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not offended, Fr&auml;ulein, at what I am
afraid must be my unwarrantable curiosity?&#8221;
Von Tressen asked hurriedly, before they should
turn the angle of the house and confidential talk
should be at an end.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had offended me,&#8221; she replied with a
look which was yet more convincing than her words,
&#8220;the question would have been unnecessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their steps had lingered, had become slower and
slower, till now they stopped by the corner of the
house which just screened them from Harlberg and
Galabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too good,&#8221; Von Tressen said in a half
whisper, &#8220;to let me speak to you like this. You
will not forget, Fr&auml;ulein, if ever you are in trouble,
you owe me the privilege of coming to your help.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a little laugh which stopped short of
gaiety. &#8220;Let us hope,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it will not be
necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if it be?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>&#8220;Then I shall call you.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was earnest beneath the half jest, and each
intuitively recognized it, although perhaps neither
quite imagined how near the surface it lay. As
Philippa spoke the last words she put out her hand
to emphasize, as it were, the promise. Von Tressen
grasped it in both his, and was lifting it to his lips,
when he suddenly raised his bent head almost in
dismay. Philippa had snatched her hand back.
A shadow darkened the angle of the wall, and
Count Zarka stood before them, the ever-ready smile
on his face, this time a smile of detection.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are fond of playing hide and seek, gn&auml;dige
Fr&auml;ulein,&#8221; he said.</p>

<small>WHO IS THIS MAN?</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Your</span> taste, my dear Osbert, is unimpeachable,&#8221;
Galabin remarked as they left the farm; &#8220;the
Fr&auml;ulein is delightful. And yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet, Mr. Secret-Agent? A new mystery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps. For I do not quite make out your
friends. Herr Harlberg comes for sport, here to a
wild farmhouse, yet he does not shoot, nor does he
seem very keen about it. For I made a point of
talking sport and he yawned; he was as bored
as a man can well be. Then their connexion with
our amiable friend from Rozsnyo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you make out of that?&#8221; Von Tressen
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; was the blunt answer; &#8220;nothing
as yet, that is. But I shall hope to unriddle that
little enigma before long. For I fancy there is some
peculiar bond between them. They are rather
more than acquaintances or even friends, or my
faculty of observation is less than I take it to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What reason have you for that idea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Merely certain signs that came under my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
observation, slight enough in themselves, but together
quite significant. I am accustomed to
putting two and two together, and I don&#8217;t want to
boast, but if I had been a dense numskull, who
could not take in what was going on before his eyes,
why, our Chancellor would hardly have chosen me
for the business. I can tell you one thing, my
friend. The Count looked black when he heard
you had strolled off with the young lady. Yes;
there was murder in his eye, for all the grin on his
lips.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he immediately came after us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like a panther. I called him back, just for
the fun of the thing, and as he turned impatiently
I saw the face without the grin. It was not pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The subject was broken off by an exclamation
from Von Tressen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! Is not that yonder our friend of last
night?&#8221;</p>

<p>From the glade along which they were sauntering
a track led up to a small eminence, beyond which
was a space of lawn and underwood extending to
the house they had just left. On the summit,
at the edge of the wood, leaning against a tree,
stood a man; the same, they felt sure, whom they
had seen at Rozsnyo in the darkness. He held a
gun by his side, the butt resting on the ground,
and by his attitude he seemed to be watching the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
farm. His face was set in that direction as he stood
motionless, except that once or twice he moved
his head as though following some object with his
eyes, or to get a better view.</p>

<p>For a while the two friends stood observing him,
then by a common impulse they stepped back
out of the line of the path, so that if the man turned
he should not see that he was being watched.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is he doing there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Watching the farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should he watch it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was not to be so easily answered.
For a few moments neither man spoke. Then
Galabin said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must inquire into this, and find out who the
fellow is. It is absurd to continue in our present
ignorance without making an effort to dispel it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Von Tressen nodded his agreement. &#8220;Let us
accost him now, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but not from behind. Don&#8217;t let him suspect
we have been watching him. We had better
stalk him round and come upon him along the ridge
of the hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We may frighten him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly think so. In that case we must follow
him up or wait for another opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin&#8217;s anticipation was correct. When they
had reached the high ground by a detour, they could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
see through the trees the man still standing there
in his watchful attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Von Tressen murmured, &#8220;let us get
almost up to him without attracting his attention,
and then show ourselves. It will be too late for
him to run away then.&#8221;</p>

<p>The plan was carried out with perfect success.
The man was evidently too absorbed in his watching
to be aware of their approach; giving no sign
of alertness or of moving from his station. Only
when they suddenly emerged into the open did he
withdraw his gaze from the farm lying below in the
valley, and turn it quickly, with a kind of fierce
suspicion, on the figures which had come within its
focus. He made a quick movement and instinctively
lifted his gun from the ground, only to replace it
and resume his attitude, as watching till the two
should have passed on.</p>

<p>But that was scarcely their intention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-day, mein Herr,&#8221; Galabin said as they
both saluted the man. &#8220;You are a sportsman
like ourselves. May we hope that you have been
more successful than we?&#8221;</p>

<p>They rather expected a churlish reply; but, as
Galabin spoke, the somewhat fierce, stern expression
on the man&#8217;s face relaxed, and he answered almost
laughingly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are companions in ill-luck. I, too, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
nothing to show. Perhaps in my case it has been
bad markmanship, want of skill rather than of luck.
What I have hit has not been worth the picking up.
But then the forest is so beautiful that it repays one
for bad sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a sweep with his hand towards the valley
stretching away below them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are staying in the forest, mein Herr?&#8221;
Galabin enquired with careless politeness. &#8220;At
the Schloss Rozsnyo, perhaps?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man darted a keen glance at him. &#8220;At
Rozsnyo? No. My quarters are at a little inn.
A wretched place frequented only by woodcutters
and charcoal burners. But what would you
have?&#8221; he added with a shrug. &#8220;Sport does not
always go with comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Its absence makes the zest for sport all the
keener,&#8221; Von Tressen remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is your opinion,&#8221; the stranger returned,
&#8220;I shall not perhaps be wrong in hazarding a guess
that the tent I have seen hereabouts forms your
shooting quarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right,&#8221; Galabin replied. &#8220;We
follow our pleasure gipsy fashion. If you would
stroll back with us and join our mid-day meal we
should be honoured. Our little encampment is
but a stone&#8217;s throw from here, and your inn must
be some distance.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>The man bowed with an excess of courtesy.
&#8220;The honour is mine,&#8221; he responded. &#8220;I shall
be charmed, if I am not putting you to inconvenience.
My inn is far from here, and, apart from that, to a
lonely man the chance of a chat in congenial company
is not to be despised.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shouldered his gun and they turned down the
hill again. Walking with a quick, impatient stride,
their new acquaintance seemed now a restless,
energetic man, and this made his late motionless,
patient attitude the more unaccountable.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Schloss Rozsnyo,&#8221; he said presently, in
his abrupt quick way, &#8220;it is a fine place, but in a
curious situation here in this wild forest. You
know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been there,&#8221; Galabin answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We spent a couple of hours there yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, then you know Count Zarka?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man turned with a fierce eagerness to him
as he put the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;We know him slightly from a casual meeting
in the forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; He said no more, for they were within
a few yards of the tent. But after luncheon, when
they were sitting with their cigars and coffee in the
open, their guest, who had told them his name was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
Abele d&#8217;Alquen, brought up the subject again, as,
indeed, both men felt sure he would.</p>

<p>&#8220;This Rozsnyo,&#8221; he began, waving his hand in
the direction of the Schloss, &#8220;it is a very wonderful
place?&#8221;</p>

<p>They gave him a simple description of its principal
objects of interest. He listened with a sort of
sharp curiosity, and seemed particularly struck
by their account of the underground armoury.</p>

<p>&#8220;An extraordinary place,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Quite
a curiosity; you are fortunate to have seen it.
I suppose there are other rooms dug out in the rock,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There may be,&#8221; Von Tressen replied. &#8220;We
did not see any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unheard-of labour to construct them, eh?&#8221;
D&#8217;Alquen continued, in the fierce abrupt way which
seemed more natural to him than the tone of somewhat
exaggerated courtesy he had used when they
had originally accosted him. &#8220;You think, though,
there might be other apartments down there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; Galabin replied. &#8220;Why? Are you
particularly interested in underground dwellings?&#8221;
he added with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no&mdash;yes, I am fond of engineering,&#8221; the
other answered. &#8220;Did you see doors or passages
in the rock?&#8221;</p>

<p>His two hosts glanced at each other, repressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
a smile. Galabin replied: &#8220;I noticed nothing
of the sort; did you, Von Tressen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; the Lieutenant corroborated.</p>

<p>For a few moments their guest was silent. Then
he suddenly asked: &#8220;You went all over the
Schloss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly all over; but we saw everything which,
according to the Count, was worth seeing. I
do not think we told you of the beautiful private
chapel in the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A loud laugh from D&#8217;Alquen made him stop short.
It was a curious laugh of derision on a single sustained
note, and it rang through the forest, so as
to be almost startling in the silence around.</p>

<p>&#8220;A chapel!&#8221; he exclaimed in reply to their stare
of astonishment. Their guest was every moment
becoming more of a puzzle. &#8220;A chapel! That
is a comical idea. The Count is pious, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can hardly answer for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>D&#8217;Alquen laughed again, this time not so loudly,
but with a jarring, sarcastic note.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; we can answer for no man outside our
own skin, not even for the honourable Count Zarka.
And if my estimate of that nobleman is not wrong,
the man would be rash indeed who would answer
for his piety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know him, then?&#8221; Galabin asked, still
more mystified.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>D&#8217;Alquen threw out his arms with a gesture of
protest. &#8220;Not I. Only by sight, that is, unless I
have set down the wrong man for the Count. A
dark man, handsome, yes, if it were not for a sinister
expression and the grin of a wolf. He rides a roan
horse often in the forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the Count,&#8221; Von Tressen assented.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw him,&#8221; the other continued, &#8220;this morning,
shortly before I had the pleasure of meeting you
gentlemen. He rode over to that old house in the
valley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; we saw him there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; The intense, fierce curiosity seemed to
surge back into their guest&#8217;s face. &#8220;You were there,
at that curious house? You have friends there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin hesitated a moment, then, judging it
safest to be straight-forward, he answered: &#8220;We
happen to know the people who are staying there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes?&#8221; The man&#8217;s curiosity was insatiable;
it seemed to increase with every fresh point it seized
upon. &#8220;An old gentleman and a young lady. May
one without offence ask who they are?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had suddenly checked the vehemence of his
manner, and the last question was put almost carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not suppose there is any harm in my
mentioning their name,&#8221; Galabin replied. &#8220;It
is Harlberg.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;Harlberg? So! Harlberg. Herr and Fr&auml;ulein
Harlberg? The lady is his daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen had repeated the name curiously.
There was hardly offence in his intonation,
but it brought a frown to Von Tressen&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;They live here? No?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Harlberg stays in the forest for sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For sport? Indeed?&#8221; The exclamation was
almost offensive in its suggested incredulity. &#8220;He
is a great friend of the Count Zarka&mdash;or the lady is,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really cannot tell you, mein Herr,&#8221; Von Tressen
answered sharply, with rising irritation as the other&#8217;s
inquisitiveness now touched him more nearly.
&#8220;I made the acquaintance of Herr Harlberg and
his daughter only a few days ago, and my curiosity
is hardly as keen as yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant D&#8217;Alquen seemed as though he
would be provoked to a hot retort; his eyes had
an angry gleam, but he checked the impulse, and
his expression changed to a smile as he made a
deprecating wave of his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, Lieutenant. I did not intend that
my curiosity should exceed the bounds of good
taste. I cannot afford&#8221;&mdash;he gave a laugh&mdash;&#8220;to
risk giving you offence. Only here in this wild
part everything seems so strange that one feels
bound to ask questions of the rare human beings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
one meets. Let me not abuse your hospitality by
asking another.&#8221;</p>

<p>Von Tressen could but make a good-humoured
reply, even though he felt the guest&#8217;s explanation
was hardly convincing, and after a little desultory
chat D&#8217;Alquen rose and took his leave, saying he
had a long walk to his inn, but would hope to meet
and shoot with them on the morrow or the day
after.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot make him out,&#8221; Galabin said when they
were alone, in answer to Von Tressen&#8217;s question.
&#8220;He is another enigma added to our stock awaiting
solution. But of one thing I am quite certain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is that our new acquaintance had as little
thought of sport when he came to the forest as
had Herr Harlberg or even I myself.&#8221;</p>

<small>A STRANGE PRESERVER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning Philippa, taking a book with her,
set off for a quiet stroll in the forest. The unaccustomed
monotony of her life at the old Grange,
shut up with her step-father, whose temper, always
inclined to peevishness, the boredom of the situation
did not improve, was irksome to her. But beyond
and above this negative evil was the positive one
of Zarka&#8217;s constant visits and veiled persecution.
Against the idea that he had any hold over her she
fought strenuously; she would not allow it, even
to herself, yet she had an uneasy consciousness
that the Count&#8217;s language was apt to take the form
of a scarcely disguised threat. And here, in the
vast lonely forest, under the dominating seigniory
of Rozsnyo, it seemed difficult to fight against the
strong hand backed by the resolute will. Civilization
here hardly counted; might was still right as
in feudal days, and the only chance of safety seemed
to lie in temporizing and not driving the enemy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
extreme measures. The oppressive vastness, the
weird silence and gloom of the forest lay on her
nerves; Zarka seemed to be the evil genius of that
great region of mountain woodland, and nature here
to be his ally.</p>

<p>Anyhow that morning, she told herself, she would
be free from him, and with that object she avoided
the open tracks along which he was wont to ride,
and kept well within the thickness of the wood
where never even a bridle-path was to be found.
The Count&#8217;s favourite roan would hardly thread
its way amid that tangle of brushwood and maze
of trees. When Philippa felt she had wandered
far enough, she chose an inviting bank with a tree
to lean against and sat down to read. She had
turned but a few pages when she looked up with a
start. There was a stealthy rustling in the undergrowth
near. After a few moments of alarmed
expectancy Philippa sprang to her feet with a look
of terror. Two fierce eyes were glaring at her from
behind the fringe of brushwood some ten yards
away. She kept sufficient presence of mind, however,
to be able to tell that, for good or ill, they were
not human eyes. A snarling grunt confirmed this;
the intruder was a wild boar. Philippa instinctively
gathered up her dress and turned to run; at the
movement the animal with a louder growl broke
through into the open space. She caught one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
glimpse of his ugly tusks, his bristling hair and ears,
his savage little eyes, and in utter terror rushed
in a panic away through the trees. Escape from
the brute seemed out of the question; she felt it
was coming on in hot pursuit, could hear it brushing
through the leaves, and its peculiar savage cry, ever
nearer, made her sick with fear. It was close on her;
she darted to one side, and, facing the animal, hopelessly
tried to dodge it among the trees. Furious
at being thus baffled, the boar made deadly charges,
running round the trees with head lowered, and
hunting the girl viciously from one to another.
She was becoming exhausted with the unequal
strife; it was a wonder she had avoided the fatal
tusks so long, every fresh rush she felt must end the
business. She cried out despairingly, sending up
shriek upon shriek. Faint with the terror of death,
now so imminent, she had actually ceased to try
and avoid the brute, when suddenly a man&#8217;s voice
cried out with startling clearness&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get away from him! Quick! I am going to
shoot!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a supreme effort Philippa made a vigorous
spring, by which she put a yard or so between her
and the boar just as his tusks had come within
striking distance. A shot rang out, the brute rolled
over, not killed outright, but at least disabled from
further attack.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>With a gasping cry of relief and thankfulness
Philippa sank down half fainting, as the man who
had fired the shot ran quickly forward. It was
Abele d&#8217;Alquen.</p>

<p>His first act was to satisfy himself that the boar&#8217;s
power for harm was at an end. Perhaps he forebore
giving the animal its <i>coup-de-gr&acirc;ce</i> out of consideration
for the girl&#8217;s presence. Taking out a flask,
he dropped on one knee beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;A narrow escape, Fr&auml;ulein. Drink this; it
will revive you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said, declining the flask with
a slight motion of the hand. &#8220;I shall be all right
again directly. But it gave me a terrible fright.&#8221;</p>

<p>D&#8217;Alquen laughed. &#8220;Small wonder. You were
not far from death, Fr&auml;ulein, and hardly a pleasant
one. Ah!&#8221; he looked round at the writhing
animal. &#8220;It was a pretty shot; I was glad to have
the chance of making it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I thank you?&#8221; Philippa said gratefully,
sitting up now and passing her handkerchief
over her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need to thank me,&#8221; he returned
with what seemed a strange brusqueness. &#8220;All
the same, you may as well thank fate that decreed
I should be passing this way in the nick of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have saved my life,&#8221; she said warmly,
setting down his deprecation to a natural modesty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>&#8220;Let us hope,&#8221; he replied, in the same almost
ungracious tone, &#8220;that it has not been preserved
for a worse misfortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentiment was obvious and unanswerable,
but hardly gallant. His manner seemed to check
rudely the flow of her gratitude. Still she made yet
another effort to thank him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I hope you will believe
that I am very, very grateful to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can believe it,&#8221; he returned curtly, with an
almost formal bow.</p>

<p>Philippa had risen to her feet now, and for a few
moments they stood together in an awkward
silence. Then D&#8217;Alquen spoke, in his quick, fierce
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg, living at the old
farm in the valley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, with a touch of surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father, Herr Harlberg, comes here for
sport, does he not?&#8221; She nodded an affirmative.
&#8220;Has he shot much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; she answered, in rising wonder.
&#8220;My father&#8217;s health has not been very good.&#8221;</p>

<p>D&#8217;Alquen smiled, and the incredulity in his smile
left, on the score of politeness, something to be
desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are great friends of Count Zarka of Rozsnyo?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>A strange, not yet accountable apprehension
was beginning to steal over her. But she answered
the man&#8217;s catechism unfalteringly, feeling that he
had perhaps a right, since she owed him her life,
to put questions which nothing but his manner
suggested were prompted by more than simple,
if insistent, curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;We know Count Zarka.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; His tone indicated that he was sure of
it. &#8220;You know Count Zarka,&#8221; he repeated. Then
his manner changed abruptly, and for the better.
With an apologetic smile he said, &#8220;I ought to ask
pardon for all these rude questions. I have only
one more, mein Fr&auml;ulein.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced at him as he stood before her, almost
with a suggestion of barring her way. The smile
was still on his lips, but the reassurance caused by
his last speech died away as she noticed that his
eyes were not in accord with it. Their expression
was stern and malignant.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is the last question?&#8221; she asked,
smiling to cloak her uneasiness.</p>

<p>D&#8217;Alquen drew a deep breath, as a man will
before taking a plunge or dealing a blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know&mdash;you knew Prince Roel of Rapsberg?&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed on her face with a glittering
eagerness. Somehow, by a strange prescience,
she had felt that the question would refer to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
vanished prince. So, fortunately, she was hardly
taken by surprise, and could answer steadily&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have met Prince Roel in town and have danced
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know he has mysteriously disappeared?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mein Herr,&#8221; she returned, with a touch of
bantering reproof, &#8220;you said there was only one
more question to conclude your catechism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot answer this?&#8221; he demanded
sharply and fiercely.</p>

<p>His manner gave her a thrill of fear, but she
fought against betraying it. &#8220;Answer it, mein
Herr? There is not much to answer. I have
heard the report like the rest of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave a toss of the head. &#8220;Yes, yes. Before
you left the city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet another question? Certainly. One hears
nothing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not from Count Zarka?&#8221; His questions
flashed out like the quick thrusts of a rapier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will the examination be much longer?&#8221;
Philippa asked with a little grimace of impatience.
&#8220;For I must be going homewards; my father will
be anxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Harlberg&mdash;that is your father&#8217;s name?&#8221;
he asked with dart-like suddenness. Philippa
nodded assent. &#8220;Herr Harlberg may be glad
that he sees you at all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;That is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you,&#8221; he continued, in the same
sharp, masterful tone, &#8220;why I have detained you
to ask these questions?&#8221;</p>

<p>Had she dared she would have declined to hear
the reason, but she was in the power of this strange
questioner, and knew it would not serve to ignore
the curiosity which, indeed, she felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You at least owe it to me to tell that,&#8221; she
replied with a smile.</p>

<small>AFTER THE PERIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> drew a step nearer to her and fixed his dark eyes
piercingly on her face. His manner was not rough;
hardly, in its outward form, uncivil; yet there was
in it a suggestion of a wild purpose, a strong reckless
will that overmastered her. Still she fought against
her fear and his indefinable mastery, facing him
boldly for the explanation which she dreaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I will tell you.&#8221; As he spoke there came
through the wood the sound of an approaching
presence. Both looked quickly round, and D&#8217;Alquen
caught up his gun. It was, however, no wild animal
this time, but a man, Osbert Von Tressen.</p>

<p>He greeted them in surprise. &#8220;Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg!
Herr D&#8217;Alquen!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>There was genuine relief on the girl&#8217;s face, a
lowering annoyance on her companion&#8217;s, who, however,
met the situation unhesitatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are well met, Herr Lieutenant,&#8221; he cried
with a half sneer. &#8220;But you would have come too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
late. You are surprised at finding us here together.
The explanation lies there.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a slightly theatrical action he pointed to
the boar. &#8220;I have had the honour of relieving the
honoured Fr&auml;ulein from the too pressing attentions
of that fellow,&#8221; he continued, in reply to Von
Tressen&#8217;s exclamation of surprise. &#8220;Half an hour
ago three were better company than two; that
exigency is past, and now two are preferable to
three. I bid you good-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised his hat, made them each a ceremonious
bow, turned abruptly, and walked resolutely away.
For some moments they both watched him in
astonished silence; although his face had betrayed
no feeling, his manner of leaving them was altogether
strange; very soon the depth of the wood hid him
from sight, and they could look round inquiringly
at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad you came,&#8221; Philippa said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came?&#8221; Von Tressen returned a little ruefully.
&#8220;No; he. He saved you from that ugly
brute.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. &#8220;Yes; he saved my life. And
frightened me horribly afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did? Yes, I can understand it. He is a
queer fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>He told her of their meeting on the previous day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;Neither Galabin nor I could make him out,&#8221; he
added. &#8220;How did he frighten you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, perhaps I ought not to have been afraid,&#8221;
she answered with a laugh. &#8220;Only he asked me
questions in such a fierce, strange way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! As he did yesterday when he was with
us. If he did not frighten us, at least he puzzled
us horribly. I fear that, what with that fellow and
this,&#8221; pointing to the boar, &#8220;and Count Zarka, you
will be glad when your stay in the forest comes to
an end, Fr&auml;ulein.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps. And yet, how lovely it would be if
one might only enjoy it unmolested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By man and beast,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;I would
take your hint, Fr&auml;ulein, if I did not consider it my
duty to stay near for your protection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not mean it as a hint,&#8221; she replied simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you do not wish me to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;stay. At least, no; it is
getting late, and I must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for a few minutes,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;You are
hardly recovered from the shock of your danger.
Sit down here and rest first.&#8221;</p>

<p>A bank rising to the gnarled tree-roots made an
inviting couch, and they sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; Von Tressen said, &#8220;I had come along
this way half an hour earlier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, too, wish you had,&#8221; she replied frankly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
&#8220;Still I ought to be thankful that some one was at
hand to save me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And may I not be thankful, too?&#8221; he said
warmly. &#8220;Only, if it had been my luck to have
been the man, it might have expiated the wound
I inflicted by saving you from a worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you that your act is already expiated,&#8221;
she said softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might have been wiped out, forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I do not want to forget it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fr&auml;ulein! You like to remember that I gave
you pain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we not told that pain often brings good in
its train?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, if you thought that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A sting on my fingers has brought me a friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than that, if you will see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than a friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand. &#8220;Much more, unless that is
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>She let her hand stay in his, although her head
was turned from him as she sat looking away into
the thick phalanx of trees. A weasel ran out into
the little open space before them, looked inquiringly
at Philippa, as though wondering what her answer
would be, and then with a zig-zag flash vanished
into covert again. Every added moment of silence
strengthened Von Tressen&#8217;s hope.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;Philippa,&#8221; he pleaded, drawing her hand to
him, &#8220;may I be no more than that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that she turned her face to him he was sure
of her answer, for he could see nothing but love in
her eyes. Next instant he was on his knees by her
side kissing her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You love me, Philippa? You must tell me
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you,&#8221; she whispered; &#8220;could I help
loving you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then suddenly she rose and stretched out her
hands to keep him from her. &#8220;Ah, but this is
madness,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;The passing romance of a
forest holiday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;Philippa, my love,
how can you say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What could you do,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;but make
love to me, after our first strange encounter and our
meetings in the glamour of the forest. And then
under the shadow of the dragon&#8217;s castle of Rozsnyo.
Is not Perseus bound to imagine himself in love
with Andromeda? Ah, Osbert Von Tressen, do not
deceive yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>So fearing, questioning, protesting, she kept him,
all to prove his love, at arm&#8217;s length, till at last
conviction was so insistent that she could no longer
even pretend a doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, love me, dear one,&#8221; she whispered, as his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
arms were round her again, &#8220;for my love is more
than I can tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the romance of the forest,&#8221; he murmured
slily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, darling, yes; for that is you. I should hate
the forest instead of loving it had you not been in
it. Now, dear,&#8221; she continued with a serious face,
&#8220;our love must be a secret&mdash;hush! only for a little
time; just while we are here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A secret?&#8221; he exclaimed in surprise. &#8220;From
your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, even from him. It is only for a little while.
You will not mind, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was troubled at the idea of a secret where no
mystery should be. Galabin&#8217;s suspicions about
Philippa and her father came to his mind; and yet,
when he looked into her eyes they seemed to give
the lie to any suggestion of wrong or deceit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, dearest,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;it shall be as
you wish.&#8221; She gave him a little grateful nod and
smile. &#8220;Shall I not be allowed to know why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rather to his surprise Philippa did not withhold
a reason. &#8220;My father,&#8221; she answered with a touch
of diffidence, &#8220;has views for my future; he makes
plans&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Count Zarka comprised in them?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed. &#8220;My father likes the Count better
than I do. There! is not that enough, Osbert?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
We need only keep our secret till we leave here. In
the city Count Zarka&#8217;s power will go for little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not allow him to be omnipotent even in the
forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but,&#8221; she remonstrated with fearfulness,
&#8220;you do not know how great his power for evil is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more than any other man&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and yes,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;For he is false
and unscrupulous, and lets nothing stand against
his will. Osbert,&#8221; she laid her hand beseechingly
on his shoulder, &#8220;you must promise not to be rash,
not to offend Count Zarka. I know you are brave
and care nothing for him, but your very straight-forwardness
makes you no match for his methods.
Promise me, dearest. You must not run into
hidden danger like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impatient as he was to lay bare the mystery,
he yet felt that patience was the wiser course, and
he could but give his word not to come to open
defiance of the Count. So the promise was given
and sealed.</p>

<small>WHAT ZARKA FOUND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Count Zarka</span> had paid his accustomed visit to
Gorla&#8217;s farm, and was far from pleased to find
Philippa absent, and no hint left behind of her
whereabouts. He chatted for a while with her
father, but the talk on either side was hardly of an
exhilarating nature, both men having in their hearts
a cause for annoyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has your friend, the Lieutenant, been over here
this morning?&#8221; Zarka asked unceremoniously.</p>

<p>Harlberg shook his head ill-humouredly. &#8220;No.
I have seen nobody, but Philippa for a moment.
This is exile, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>His guest gave a shrug. &#8220;Unhappily a necessary
evil, although one which you may hope need not
last much longer. But we will try and make it
as pleasant as you will allow us. My cousin Royda
d&#8217;Ivady is anxious to come over and see your
daughter. Fr&auml;ulein Philippa seems to avoid company,
and we do not like to intrude.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>Perhaps it occurred to Harlberg that his
guest was hardly the man to let any diffidence on
that score stand in the way of his pleasure; but he
merely replied by a few words of protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had, indeed, a message from my cousin,&#8221;
Zarka said, rising to conclude an interview which
bored him. &#8220;Have you any idea which direction
Fr&auml;ulein Philippa took?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. She said nothing to me, except that she
was going. Will you leave your message, Count?&#8221;</p>

<p>No; it was hardly worth while. The Count
would probably meet the Fr&auml;ulein, as he was going
to ride home by the forest. So, with an impatience
he scarcely troubled to disguise, he took his leave.</p>

<p>But he did not meet Philippa as he expected.
She and her lover avoided the open rides on their
walk homewards, for interruption was just then the
last thing they courted. Within a radius of a good
mile from the farm the Count cantered, up one path,
down another, ever keeping his sharp eyes on the
alert, but all to no purpose. Not a sign of her
whom he sought was to be seen. He was, assuredly,
not a man who took baffling well, and his expression
as he urged his horse in and out the woodland tracks
was not an amiable one.</p>

<p>Suddenly something happened which intensified
his alertness. As he rode down a somewhat wilder
and more intricate path his horse jibbed and shied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
slightly, showing unmistakable signs of uneasiness.
Knowing that the well-trained animal would not
behave thus without good cause, Zarka took notice
of the side from which the disquieting influence
proceeded, and then, dismounting, he pushed his
way through the undergrowth to discover the
reason. It lay but a few paces before him&mdash;the
wild boar which D&#8217;Alquen had wounded, and which
now lay dead where he had fallen. A very cursory
glance enabled the Count to take in the fact that
the animal had been shot. He looked round for
farther evidence; he listened eagerly for voices.
Nothing unusual was to be seen or heard. To his
sportsman&#8217;s eye the track of the boar was plainly
indicated. He followed it for a short distance and
came upon a book lying on the ground. He eagerly
picked it up. It was a novel, and on the fly leaf
was written in pencil &#8220;Philippa Carlstein.&#8221; He
shut the book with an impatient flick, and looked
round with lowering face. For a while he stood
in thought, as though imagining what had occurred
there. The fancy was not a pleasant one, to judge
by the deepening frown and the set jaw; presently
he roused himself to action, thrust the book into his
pocket, went with quick, purposeful step back to
where he had tied his horse, mounted and rode off
towards the grange. He trotted his horse up to the
door at a pace which spoke of haste and importance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>&#8220;Herr Harlberg!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Herr Harlberg!&#8221;</p>

<p>Harlberg hurried out with more eagerness than
he was used to show about anything. &#8220;What is
the matter, Count?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fr&auml;ulein Philippa? Has she returned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not five minutes ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven be thanked,&#8221; Zarka exclaimed with
simulated relief. &#8220;I feared an accident had befallen
her. General, you ought to warn her against
solitary strolls in the forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what made you think anything was
wrong, Count?&#8221; Harlberg asked, in a tone which
did not indicate that he was absolutely convinced
of his visitor&#8217;s sincerity.</p>

<p>But Zarka knew both his man and the power of a
surprise. He was not going to discount the effect
of his discovery upon Philippa by allowing the knowledge
of it to filter through her father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask Fr&auml;ulein Philippa to come to us,&#8221; he said
almost peremptorily, as he swung himself out of the
saddle and entered the house, &#8220;and you shall hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harlberg called her, and she came into the room
where Zarka stood impatiently playing with his
riding whip. His quick eye detected a certain only
half hidden radiance in her face, and he felt that he
could guess its cause. Harlberg turned to him invitingly
for his explanation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Zarka began, &#8220;I have to congratulate
you, Fr&auml;ulein, on a lucky escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>He told himself that he was right to have taken
her by surprise, for she looked at him with a start
of obvious discomposure.</p>

<p>&#8220;How, Count?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the tusks of one of the most formidable
wild boars I have come across for many a
day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you know?&#8221; she said with a smile, having
recovered command of herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he returned almost viciously, &#8220;I know.
Know enough to be sure that I might easily at this
moment be condoling with the General rather than
congratulating you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was puzzled to know how he had found it
out, and he intended that she should be in the dark
till he was master of the facts. He turned to Harlberg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fancy, General. A monstrous brute, with
fangs as long as that&#8221;&mdash;he indicated a length on
his riding whip. &#8220;No unarmed man would have
had a chance against him. It was a providential
escape, Fr&auml;ulein, and one which might hardly happen
twice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You told me nothing of this, Philippa,&#8221; Harlberg
said, in a tone of aggrieved reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not seen you, father,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
dress was torn and I had to change it. Of course
I was going to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka laid his hat and whip on the table. &#8220;Pray
let us hear the full account of it now,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Philippa told the story shortly, and had the satisfaction
of seeing that the Count&#8217;s conjectures as
to her preserver were upset when she described him
as a stranger. Indeed, D&#8217;Alquen&#8217;s identity seemed
to concern him more than her safety, or the danger
she had courted.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the man who shot the brute?&#8221; he asked, as
the story came to an end and Harlberg had rounded
it off with a reproving comment. &#8220;A stranger,
you say? You had never seen him before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Nor, but for the fact
that he saved my life, should I wish to see him
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka was all curiosity. &#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His manner was disagreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child,&#8221; Harlberg objected, &#8220;under the
circumstances you can hardly criticise his manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;only, when it was
all over, he frightened me almost as much as the
boar had done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Will you describe the fellow to me,&#8221;
Zarka said, &#8220;that I may know him if we meet, as is
probable?&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa did so, relating also the way in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
D&#8217;Alquen had questioned her. The Count was darkly
suspicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything to do, think you, with the Prince Roel
affair?&#8221; Harlberg asked, impressed by the other&#8217;s
gravity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; Zarka replied with a tolerant smile.
He was not playing the game with this dull, uninteresting
old soldier, but with his step-daughter.
Presently the opportunity came for which he had
waited. Harlberg left them together.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have passed through a great danger to-day,
Fr&auml;ulein,&#8221; Zarka said, changing his manner to
one of intensely sympathetic interest. &#8220;I blame
myself that it is I who am indirectly responsible
for it. I wish you would give me the right to
protect you from all these risks in future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not likely,&#8221; she replied coldly, ignoring
his tone of caress, &#8220;to put myself in the way of such
danger again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From wild animals, no; let us hope not. But
from men hardly less dangerous. You cannot feel
safe there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; she rejoined, &#8220;my life will not be
passed in a place like this, where protection seems
so necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned forward. &#8220;Why should it not?&#8221; he
asked earnestly. &#8220;Why should it not, much of it,
be passed here, as mistress of Rozsnyo?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>She rose, not trusting herself to look at him.
&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;That cannot be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be, easily,&#8221; he persisted, following her.
&#8220;You have only to say the little word, Yes. You
will say it, Philippa? You must know how devotedly
I love you. Dearest, you will be my
wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;I cannot be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he cried impatiently, &#8220;you do not know
what you say. You will be my wife, be queen of
this great forest, and of all that is mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand but she drew it away. &#8220;No,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;It is good of you, Count; I appreciate
the honour you offer me. But I cannot accept
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannot be my wife?&#8221; he exclaimed, with the
evil gleam in his eyes which opposition to his will
ever brought there. &#8220;You do not think what you
refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A great honour; yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man who loves you truly with heart and
soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But whom I cannot love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannot?&#8221; The draught he was swallowing
was not a pleasant one, and his face showed it.
&#8220;Not for your father&#8217;s sake, if not for your own?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;will hardly wish me
to marry a man I cannot love.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>He knew, even better than she, that her step-father
was the last man in the world to trouble
about that side of the question, providing other
considerations were favourable; but he could not
say so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father, I know,&#8221; he returned positively,
&#8220;would be glad to see you Countess
Zarka.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; she replied simply, leaving the unsatisfactory
topic of Harlberg&#8217;s views, &#8220;but it
cannot be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why not?&#8221; he demanded, hardly keeping
down his chagrin. &#8220;There can be but one reason.
Your love is, or you fancy it is, given to another
man. Tell me if it is so,&#8221; he added sharply, as she
kept silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is useless to discuss that,&#8221; she answered,
meeting his persistency with a touch of dignity.
&#8220;You must be content with the knowledge that
what you wish cannot come to pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Content!&#8221; he echoed. &#8220;Content is scarcely
the doctrine to preach to me. You might know
that, Philippa, and my character better than to
suggest it. I do not take your refusal, for it is not
logical; it is&mdash;I know, though you may not&mdash;it is
against your best interests. No,&#8221; he continued,
with the set tone of a determined will, &#8220;I am not
the man to be content to let another snatch the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
prize I covet. You will reconsider your answer,
Philippa? Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;No, Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed. &#8220;Then let your lover look to himself.
He will need great resources and the Devil&#8217;s
luck into the bargain who enters the lists with
Aubray Zarka.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him, half fascinated by the power
of his remarkable personality. But she did not
falter when he held out his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not despair, Philippa,&#8221; he said with mock
deference.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be sorry to think you did,&#8221; she returned,
meeting his eyes boldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he rejoined, understanding the words
as she meant them. &#8220;We shall see.&#8221; Against her
will he kept her hand in his. &#8220;It is a pity,&#8221; he
added suddenly, &#8220;that, instead of your uncivil
preserver, the gallant Lieutenant Von Tressen did
not come along and shoot the boar. That shot
would have paid for the other. Is the finger
healed?&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent down as though to examine her hand,
and suddenly, before she could prevent him, pressed
it to his lips. Then he laughed again. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be offended, mein Fr&auml;ulein; I shall kiss your lips
before this day week,&#8221; he said.</p>

<small>THE COUNT AND HIS SHADOW</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> leaving the farm Count Zarka rode straight to
Rozsnyo. In the hall he encountered Royda
d&#8217;Ivady, and they went into the library together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, too, have been riding in the forest,&#8221; the girl
said, &#8220;and met your friend, Lieutenant Von Tressen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka looked at her sharply. &#8220;Ah? Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was coming from the direction of the farm,
where your friends the Harlbergs are staying.&#8221;</p>

<p>Watching him expectantly, she saw his face grow
dark. &#8220;He had not been to the farm,&#8221; he said,
for once off his guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, then you have been there, Aubray?&#8221; she
returned, forcing a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had good reason to go there,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;A serious thing has happened to Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg.
She was attacked by a wild boar in the
forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So! Then that is what the Lieutenant meant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lieutenant?&#8221; Zarka exclaimed sharply.
&#8220;What did he know? What did he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jealous herself, Royda divined the same feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
in him, and, though it stung her, she rejoiced at
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only that I was wise to ride rather than walk,
since there was danger from wild boars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think he knew that the Fr&auml;ulein had been
attacked?&#8221;</p>

<p>She delighted in feeding his jealousy since it
soothed her own and seemed, vaguely, to work
towards the end she desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not understand then,&#8221; she answered,
&#8220;but now have no doubt the Lieutenant knew all
about it. Who was privileged to rescue the poor
Fr&auml;ulein?&#8221; she went on, with a touch of banter.
&#8220;You or he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; he returned curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She vanquished the animal herself, unaided?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense, Royda!&#8221; he exclaimed impatiently.
&#8220;A stranger shot the brute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A stranger!&#8221; she echoed incredulously. &#8220;A providential
stranger. Did the Fr&auml;ulein tell you so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he snapped. Then suspiciously:
&#8220;Did the Lieutenant say he shot it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. He said nothing about the affair,
except to warn me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you think he knew of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of that,&#8221; she answered. All the same
she was not quite so sure as her tone implied.</p>

<p>Zarka walked to the window and stood looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
out. For a while there was silence, then Royda
said, half timidly&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aubray, what is this mystery about the Harlbergs?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked round sharply, then turned his head
away again. &#8220;Mystery? There is no mystery.
What makes you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is odd for them to live at that half-ruined
farmhouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But none the less attractive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are there every day, Aubray.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have business with Herr Harlberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a sigh. &#8220;It is a strange business&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; he interrupted sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;That can change you and make you so unkind
to me.&#8221; A tear glistened in her eye; her pride
made her dash it away swiftly ere he turned. He
came towards her, the deceitful face smoothed into
tenderness, although the irritation was not quite
successfully obliterated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unkind, little one?&#8221; he protested caressingly.
&#8220;You are mistaken. I could not be that. Only
I have been worried lately by political matters.
A man who plays for a great stake must not expect
to have command either of his time or his moods.
You must forgive me, Royda.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>He spoke in a tone of easy confidence, very
different to his strenuous pleading with Philippa
Harlberg. He put his arm round his cousin&#8217;s
shoulders, drew her to him and kissed her. &#8220;Am
I forgiven, little one?&#8221; To a third person the
tone of the question would have sounded indifferent
as to its answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aubray, I feared she was trying to take you
from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; you are utterly wrong,&#8221; he assured her
quite truthfully. &#8220;That is the last thing she would
try to do! I swear it, Royda. There is no love
between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I must be off again,&#8221; he said, releasing her.
&#8220;You need not be afraid,&#8221; he added with a smile.
&#8220;I am going in the opposite direction to the farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Royda would have liked him to stay, but she
knew by experience that he was not to be turned
from his intentions, and so forbore to try and keep
him. When the door had closed behind him she
walked to the window, intent on watching his departure.
On a table lay his riding whip. Impulsively
she caught it up and kissed it, pressing to her
lips that part where his hand must have held it.
Then from the window she waved her hand to him,
and stood watching till the wood hid him from
sight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>&#8220;Aubray, Aubray, my darling!&#8221; she cried, as
she turned away; &#8220;you shall be mine. If this
woman had come between us and taken your love
I would have killed her.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gun on shoulder, Zarka had set off on foot towards
the higher mountain range which backed
with abrupt and majestic elevation the dark forest
uplands as they rose towards it. He strode resolutely
on, soon leaving the warmer and more smiling
valley behind him, following a scarcely perceptible
path through the superb terraces of woods, making
his way through dense thickets, and taking all the
while little heed of the furred and feathered inhabitants
of those regions as they scampered or
whirred away on his approach. His course was
continually on an ascending gradient, and after a
good half-hour&#8217;s walking it became quite steep.
Presently the woods grew thinner and lighter, the
air cooler. A quarter of an hour more brought the
Count to the verge of the forest on the greatest
height at which it grew, and he emerged into the
blood-red sunshine and keen, cold air above the
summit of the great timber-line. Beneath him,
as he stood for a few moments to gain breath,
stretched away downwards the vast pine forests,
like a green velvet robe reaching to the bosom of
the mountain; above him majestically towered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
the bust and head in the dazzling complexion of
their eternal snows, and just then brilliantly decked
with prismatic gems under the glittering sunlight.</p>

<p>But Zarka seemed in no mood that day for sight-seeing.
After his impatient halt he went on, no
longer straight upwards, but by a jagged path
formed by a ledge on the side of the mountain.
There was no fear about the man; his nerves were
as strong as the rock he was climbing. Taking his
way up the slippery and uneven mountain track,
having on one hand a wall of rock and on the other
space with a sheer precipice below him, he never
seemed in any danger even when most surrounded
by it: his character manifestly dominated the inert
threatenings of Nature around him. He was
master of his fate and, humanly speaking, could
defy it to run counter to his will.</p>

<p>Presently his path broadened, descended abruptly,
and finally led on to a mountain road evidently
the approach to a pass, one of the few points of
communication from one side of the great range to
the other. Here were, at least, some signs of life
and occasional traffic, although dreary and primitive
enough. A walk of a few hundred yards towards
the pass brought Zarka to a wretched building
which served in that desolate region for an inn. He
walked into its one public room, called for a glass
of brandy, and threw himself on a bench. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
bearded man in a rough country dress, sitting with
his head resting on his arm, seemingly half asleep
over his glass, was the only other occupant of the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fine autumn day, friend, but cold,&#8221; Zarka
observed to him carelessly.</p>

<p>Scarcely troubling to change his attitude, the
man replied: &#8220;On the mountains, where &#8217;tis never
hot, we know not cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had spoken he raised his head, and the
two men glanced keenly at one another. Then they
nodded significantly, resuming their indifferent
attitude as the innkeeper came in with the Count&#8217;s
refreshment. When they were alone again the
man rose, crossed the floor with heavy step, and
flung himself down on the other end of the bench
on which Zarka was sitting. He slid his hand
stealthily along the space between them; the
Count&#8217;s came out furtively to meet it, both men the
while looking in front of them across the room.
When the hands were raised a little two small
envelopes lay on the bench. Talking the casual
gossip of an inn, each man moved his hand
to the paper which the other&#8217;s had held, and so drew
it back and slipped it into his pocket. The Count
sipped his brandy, or at least made a pretence of
doing so, for the rough spirit was not likely to be
to his taste.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;We live in dangerous times,&#8221; observed the
man in a casual tone, which, however, was
contradicted by the intense meaning in the look
he gave his companion; &#8220;dangerous times, and there
are many events happening and going to happen
which may not be written.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true enough,&#8221; Zarka assented, responding
to the look, but speaking in the same phlegmatic
tone. &#8220;When once it is certain that it is nobody&#8217;s
business to inquire into matters, why, anything,
be it ever so desperate, may be done with impunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, friend,&#8221; the man replied. &#8220;But
not till then. They who take forbidden paths must
walk warily. They know better than to hurry.
To rush forward is to court discovery and its consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking straight in front of him Zarka nodded
twice, and the action was calculated to leave no
doubt in his companion&#8217;s mind that he comprehended
the drift of his somewhat general remarks,
and was fully able to apply them to a particular
case. &#8220;Whereas,&#8221; he said with a half-yawn, &#8220;by
taking his time a man may tire out the vigilance
of his watchers and get through unseen. Yes, my
friend, that is very true, and is, no doubt, perfectly
understood by those whose secret actions
make our history.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>The man, affecting to change his position, touched
him sharply. Zarka glanced at him, and then at the
door. Probably none but an eye sharpened by
suspicion would have detected a form behind it as
it stood slightly open. With an alert movement
of the arm Zarka knocked over his glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Landlord!&#8221; he called, watching the door.</p>

<p>It was pushed open and the man who had stood
behind it came in, followed by the innkeeper.
Zarka ordered his glass to be refilled, then carelessly
turned his attention to the newcomer, and
conceived a shrewd idea as to his identity. The
astute Count was right in his surmise. It was the
man who had shot the boar, he who called himself
Abele d&#8217;Alquen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always maintain,&#8221; Zarka observed, as though
resuming a subject interrupted by the accident
with the glass, &#8220;that the less a man speaks the safer
he is. It is best to know nothing; it is next best
to keep others ignorant of what we know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A wise saying, friend,&#8221; his companion responded.
&#8220;Since we never know who are our
friends and who are our enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka turned quickly to him, his mouth drawn
back in a sinister smile. &#8220;Sometimes we do,&#8221; he
remarked, and the other understood him.</p>

<p>D&#8217;Alquen had taken his seat at the long narrow
table opposite. He was clearly watching them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
with hardly a pretence of doing otherwise; there
was nothing furtive about those fierce, eager,
reckless eyes. Zarka took out a cigar and lighted
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long,&#8221; he asked his companion, as he lay
back lazily puffing the smoke to the low ceiling,
&#8220;may we expect the present unsettled weather to
last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221; the other answered. &#8220;Come
back here this day week, then ask me again,&#8221;&mdash;he
laughed&mdash;&#8220;and I may tell you for certain.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few casual remarks Zarka rose. &#8220;I must
be going,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;if I would be home by
nightfall. Luckily my way is downhill. Good-day
to you, friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the Count took up his gun, D&#8217;Alquen spoke for
the first time. &#8220;Have you had sport, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very fair,&#8221; Zarka answered, with a particularly
courteous bow. &#8220;In the forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not brought your bag with you!&#8221;
D&#8217;Alquen remarked, and Zarka thought he understood
the half sneer on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shoot for sport, not for food,&#8221; he retorted.
&#8220;Good-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he came out upon the wild road the autumn
sun was already well on its downward course, and
the mountain peaks had begun to grow indistinct
in the gathering mist. Walking at a brisk pace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
he soon reached the rocky spur which interposed
between him and the great forest. Gaining the
precipitous path that led round the chasm he followed
it as familiar ground in its windings, its sudden falls
and rises. At one point it ran for a few dozen paces
across an open plateau where for a short space the
wall of rocks was broken. As Zarka advanced
across this, suddenly there rose from the great
abyss a gigantic figure terrible in its size, awful in
its weirdness, a very horror in its human image yet
ghostly form, more terrible still in its spectral likeness
to the man whom it confronted.</p>

<p>Zarka, startled by the suddenness of the apparition,
stopped dead with an involuntary gesture,
then laughed aloud, and his laugh was half that of
self-derision, half of greeting; a laugh in crescendo,
and it seemed as though the spectre joined in and
flung back its loud ending.</p>

<p>&#8220;An omen!&#8221; Zarka cried, and his voice was
carried and re-echoed far away, in and out of the
rocks and chasms. &#8220;My <i>alter ego</i>! Have you
come to bid me take courage in answer to my
prayer? Have you known my thoughts, and risen
to the bidding that was in my heart? Then you
are more than mere shadow of mortal man, bugbear
of timid ignorance; you are more than this,
you must be. You are he that serves us when we
have the courage to call you; you are myself!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
Zarka&mdash;Aubray Zarka in the forces of Nature,
outside this puny flesh; you are my ministering
familiar to give me my heart&#8217;s desire. Now you
will grant it! Give this girl to me in the teeth of
my rival, in spite of herself. Turn her heart to
me, and let her will be as nothing matched with
mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>The wild reckless spirit of the superstitious
gambler was on him. The habit of speculation,
added to the fire in the blood, had changed the sane
shrewd schemer to an almost childish omen-seeker.</p>

<p>He stretched out his hands passionately towards
the spectre. &#8220;Am I not your child&mdash;your very self
on earth? Shall I not be merged in you, and be as
you are when this clay lies cold in the ground? I
have power; power of will, power of gold! And
my power shall not be mocked. In me the heart
to desire is one with the power to have. So, my
genius&mdash;angel&mdash;devil, whate&#8217;er you be, in these
desperate passes, give me my desire; the brain,
the will, the courage&mdash;for fair or foul, harden my
heart, strengthen my hand. Be with me now, as
I shall be with you hereafter. Zarka!&#8221;</p>

<p>He shouted the last word in half mocking exaltation,
and as he ended the apostrophe the spectral
form seemed to bend over him and the cloudy
presence to surround and envelop him. It was but
the vapour descending as the sun gradually lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
its power, just as the apparition had been but the
familiar spectre of the mountains.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Zarka seemed, with a gambler&#8217;s
superstition, to regard it as an omen and an answer
to his profane prayer. He threw back his head and
stretched his arms as though he would embrace
what was but his own shadow. Then, with a more
practical impulse, he snatched up his gun, and ran
quickly on along the path, racing the great cumuli
which were rolling down from the mountain tops.
He had started only just in time, and, familiar with
the way, was able to keep in front of the pursuing
obscurity. Soon he reached in safety the dividing
ground between the snow and the commencing
line of vegetation. Here all was bright and warm
once more. Zarka, pausing with the air of a man
who has won his race, looked backwards up towards
the rolling mists and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just in time! A few seconds more of apostrophizing,
and not even my tutelar deity or demon
could have saved me from an uncomfortable night.
Well, I shall enjoy my dinner all the more from the
knowledge that I very nearly missed it. May I be
as lucky elsewhere!&#8221;</p>

<p>He went on, soon plunging down into the sloping
forest, and leisurely making his way homewards.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>THE EYES IN THE CLEFT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> giant trees of the great forest streaked the
velvety glades with their lengthening shadows as
the autumn sun touched the broken outline of the
mountain screen and sent the last of its blaze sweeping
through the valley and flooding its alleys with
purple light. A solitary ray, finding, as it were, the
clue to the maze where the forest was thickest,
stretched with insistent brilliance across a natural
arbour which lay in the most sheltered recesses of the
woodland depths. This somewhat abnormal feature
of the sylvan region reared itself in a hollow a score
of paces from one of the forest paths, and was formed
in the largest of the rocks which here for a space of
perhaps fifty yards square bulged out and reared
themselves, a rough excrescence on the plush-like
ground, and, as it might seem, an outpost of the huge
battalions towering in their grandeur but a short
league away.</p>

<p>On one side of this rocky dell the overhanging
escarpment formed a shallow recess, and in
this, on the rough bench afforded by a ledge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
rock, sat Philippa and Von Tressen. The light
falling athwart the retreat and intercepted and split
up by the sharp angles of the projecting roof, just
tinged with a stray glimmer the girl&#8217;s gold-brown
hair and sparkled in the jewel on the hand which lay
on her lover&#8217;s arm. They had met that afternoon
by arrangement, and Philippa had chosen the way
to that secluded spot as lying in a part of the forest
where riding was hardly practicable, and so out of
Count Zarka&#8217;s beat. Von Tressen had divined the
reason and gently taxed her with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why need you seek so far for a motive,&#8221; she
returned with laughing evasion. &#8220;Is this all the
thanks I get for bringing you to see this romantic
dell? It is the beauty spot of, at any rate, this
part of the forest. I found it out by accident the
other day, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought it wanted only one thing to complete
its romance,&#8221; he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir; I thought nothing of the sort. It was
before&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>But it was too late. &#8220;Before you knew me,
Philippa?&#8221; he supplied, with all an accepted lover&#8217;s
confidence. &#8220;Yes? Now you shall not deny it.
Did it seem as delightful then as it does to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; she returned archly. &#8220;There was no
sun that day; it was grey and dull, but the place
was lovely nevertheless.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>&#8220;Nothing like this?&#8221; he urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to see it in the glory of the sunlight,&#8221;
she said, still baffling him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And with me, Philippa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to bring you to see it,&#8221; she replied
fencingly, although her eyes played traitor to her
tone of laughing indifference. &#8220;It has been a long
walk, and I hope you are grateful. You know, sir,
you would probably never have discovered it for
yourself; or if you had passed by, your mind would
have been so full of partridges and hares that you
would never have noticed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so Count Zarka has nothing to do with our
coming here?&#8221; he persisted, only half convinced,
and still unable to feel happy on the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why must you harp on the Count?&#8221; she protested
with a little natural impatience. &#8220;Can you
not enjoy the short hour we have without letting
that shadow come between us? Is it not as well
that we took this secluded way, or would you rather
we went where the Count would be likely to light upon
us? I did not know you thought so much of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think very little of him, dearest,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I only wish you regarded him as indifferently as I.
It is because I feel you do not that I confess I am
not satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You silly boy!&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;I tell you the
Count is nothing to me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;You are not afraid of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are, Philippa,&#8221; he maintained. &#8220;Do tell
me why,&#8221; he added persuasively.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied, with an effort to mask the
troubled thought which lay behind her words.
&#8220;How can I, when I tell you it is not so? Count
Zarka is nothing to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An object of fear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; why should he be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what you must tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Osbert,&#8221; she said impetuously, &#8220;you are determined
to make me wretched. Can you not, to
please me, dismiss the subject of Count Zarka? I
hate it as I hate him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you are always with him?&#8221; he persisted
dubiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I help it if he comes every day to the farm?
He has business with my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Von Tressen&#8217;s face was troubled. It was clear he
felt far from satisfied. But what more could he
urge? His expression darkened as though a cloud
of gloom had drifted over him. For some moments
there was silence. Then Philippa laid her hand
lovingly on his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Osbert,&#8221; she pleaded; &#8220;you are unkind to me;
unkind to let these suspicions run in your mind.
Can you not trust me? Is your love so shallow that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
it cannot believe my word against all appearances?
Does it ask so much that I must prove to you that
I love you and hate Zarka? How can I do that?&#8221;</p>

<p>His answer was ready. &#8220;Will you tell your father
and the Count that we are betrothed?&#8221;</p>

<p>She met his eyes steadfastly. &#8220;In a week,&#8221; she
answered without faltering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Osbert, is this fair?&#8221;</p>

<p>His innate chivalry ousted his jealous suspicion.
&#8220;Forgive me, darling,&#8221; he said, as love lighted up
his face and its gloom vanished; &#8220;forgive me that
I am so unkind. I do not deserve that you should
love me when I torment you so. But I distrust this
man Zarka; I know him to be bad and unscrupulous,
and, worst of all, to be in love with you. Is it
a wonder that I am troubled when I see the fear he
inspires you with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; not fear,&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure you fear him, dear one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are wrong. Avoidance does not
necessarily imply fear. Why will you persist in
thinking that? You must have faith in me, Osbert.&#8221;</p>

<p>He could hardly resist that appeal backed by the
love that was in the look she gave him. &#8220;I am
offending again; how can I ask for pardon?&#8221; he
said lovingly. &#8220;Only if you knew how I long for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
the end of this mystery&mdash;for there surely is a mystery,
Philippa&mdash;to call you mine before the world, to defy
and triumph over this scheming fellow, Zarka, you
would not be hard on me. I want the sunshine
for our love, not to have to lurk with it in the
shade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it shall be,&#8221; she returned in the same tone.
&#8220;Only one week, and the mist shall clear away, if
indeed there be one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there not?&#8221; he asked, smiling wistfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Need there be?&#8221; she rejoined. &#8220;Is not the
sun upon us now. Ah, how lovely, it is! Osbert,
why will you torment yourself by seeing nothing
but gloom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a fool,&#8221; he said, as his trouble seemed to
vanish. &#8220;At any rate, if there is a little cloud over
us, I might know that the sun is behind it. My sun
my glorious love, Philippa, my darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her in his arms and kissed her. Suddenly
she gave a cry and started up pushing him excitedly
from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Philippa!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed on the irregular wall of rock
which ran along the opposite side of the dell.
&#8220;There,&#8221; she exclaimed under her breath, in
terror as though not daring to raise her voice,
&#8220;there, in that cleft, a man&#8217;s eyes; so horrible!
Ah!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>She shuddered in fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see nothing, dearest,&#8221; her lover said, reassuringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are gone now,&#8221; she returned, hardly daring
to look towards the place. &#8220;But I saw them; they
were there, glaring at us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will soon satisfy you,&#8221; he cried, leaving her
and hurrying forward.</p>

<p>But she followed and clung to him. &#8220;No, no!
Osbert, my love, stay here! Do not go; there is
danger,&#8221; she implored.</p>

<p>It was scarcely the argument to avail with a
soldier, and with a confident smile he released himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go and see,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;I will not
have you frightened, dear one.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran to a spot where the rocks shelved down
and afforded a possibility of climbing. It was not
by any means an easy ascent, but to an active man
it was quicker than going by the level outlet round
to the back of the rocks. Philippa followed him
half way across the hollow; then stopped, watching
him breathlessly. In a few seconds he stood on the
rocky escarpment and looked all round.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one here; no one to be seen,&#8221; he called to
her encouragingly.</p>

<p>But the fear did not leave her face: she was not
reassured.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>&#8220;Come back, Osbert,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;You will
find no one there now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stayed a little, making a cursory examination
of the place, and then rejoined her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing to be seen,&#8221; he announced cheerfully,
&#8220;Not a sign of man or beast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am certain there was some one there,&#8221; she insisted.
&#8220;Ah, those hateful eyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his arm round her protectingly. &#8220;Dearest,
you must not alarm yourself so. It was not another
of your wild boars, was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. It was a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Need you be afraid of him? It was not the only
man in the world, or in the forest,&#8221; he added with a
confident smile. Then his face darkened a little as
he said, &#8220;Was it the Count?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count Zarka?&#8221; She spoke with an effort, &#8220;I
could not tell. No. How could it have been he?
Osbert, you are sure you saw no one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite sure,&#8221; he answered. He could see that
it needed all her self-command to restrain the betrayal
of her fear. &#8220;Let us go back to our seat,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and watch for the mysterious eyes to
re-appear, I promise you their owner shall not
escape me a second time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she objected, &#8220;I must be going homewards
now. It is getting late, and my father will
wonder at my absence.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;Must you go so soon, Philippa?&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; she answered, evidently anxious
to get away from the place. &#8220;We can walk slowly,&#8221;
she added with a smile that bore down his protest.
&#8220;I love sauntering through the forest, it is a shame
to hurry; but you know we have a long way to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that they went up out of the dell, Von Tressen
looking round him sharply as they gained the
level ground outside, but seeing nothing that could
account for Philippa&#8217;s fright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you ask me whether it was Count
Zarka?&#8221; she said presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your fear put it into my head,&#8221; he answered
frankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there no other living things to fear in the
forest?&#8221; she demanded, regaining a more confident
tone as they left the somewhat eerie dell behind
them. &#8220;You forget how lately my life was in peril,
and can hardly wonder if my nerves are shaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say it is to be accounted for by that,&#8221; he
said reassuringly. &#8220;You have plenty of courage,
Philippa, more than most women, and that makes
me wonder at your evident fear of the Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is you who make a bugbear of him,&#8221; she objected,
although not very convincingly. &#8220;Ah&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>With the exclamation she caught her lover&#8217;s arm
and drew him back from the glade they had been
about to cross. Von Tressen had seen nothing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
looked at her for an explanation. The fear had
returned to her face, which had now gone white to
the lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked, trying to bend forward
and see. But she held him fast, as, with an
effort, she recovered herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very man we were speaking of,&#8221; she
answered in a hurried undertone. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him
see you. Do we want a third person on our walk
home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; Von Tressen laughed, as they slipped
back among the thick underwood. But it was too
late, for the Count came down the ride at a hand
gallop and hailed them. His quick eyes had doubtless
detected their presence at the moment Philippa
saw him.</p>

<small>ZARKA&#8217;S WARNING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a note of jeering exultation in the
Count&#8217;s voice as he called to them, as it were a
warning that it was no use their trying to escape
him. They were clearly in view and could but come
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;So our forest has even now no terrors for you,
Fr&auml;ulein,&#8221; the Count cried, hiding, as was his wont,
any particular feeling that may have been uppermost
in his mind. &#8220;I trust&mdash;&mdash; Ah, I see you
have a protector. It is good. Well met, Lieutenant.&#8221;</p>

<p>His greeting was suave, almost hearty, a good
deal too polite, both the lovers thought. He met
Von Tressen&#8217;s salute with his characteristic fixed
smile, and turned to Philippa.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are coming back to Gorla&#8217;s? Yes? You
will let me bear you company.&#8221;</p>

<p>Intention rather than request was suggested by
his tone. The proposal could not well be refused,
and although Von Tressen looked doubtfully at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
Philippa, as though he rather expected her to
decline the additional escort, she made but a feeble
demur.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be taking you out of your way, Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka waved his arm deprecatingly. &#8220;My way,&#8221;
he returned readily, &#8220;when I can choose it, is always
the pleasantest.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no further objection to be made after
the flourish of that compliment. Zarka had turned
his horse, and all three went down the glade abreast,
Von Tressen scarcely hiding his disappointment
at the intrusion, the Count chattering volubly with
an excess of small-talk in which Philippa joined with
an effort. Zarka was quite amusing, although
neither of his companions quite appreciated either
his witty turns of speech or his more obvious jokes;
but he kept up the flow, as it seemed quite spontaneously,
and insisted from time to time upon
drawing Von Tressen into the conversation by direct
appeals to his opinion, very much to the Lieutenant&#8217;s
disgust. Chafing at the man&#8217;s intrusive presence,
Von Tressen presently saw his opportunity for an
attempt to get rid of him. As they reached a
certain point in the forest path he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our nearest way to Gorla&#8217;s Farm is through
here,&#8221; he said, indicating a way amid the trees.
&#8220;We must bid you good-evening now, Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The path is quite as short,&#8221; Zarka declared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
checking an ugly look. &#8220;I am sure you will not
deprive me of the pleasure of your company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Fr&auml;ulein is tired,&#8221; Von Tressen maintained.
&#8220;It would scarcely be fair to ask her to walk all the
way round by the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you that way is equally short,&#8221; Zarka insisted,
with a grin such as the wolf may have used
to mask his feelings towards Little Red Riding
Hood.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must pardon me, Count,&#8221; Von Tressen
replied sturdily, &#8220;I know this part of the forest
well. We cut off a good quarter of a mile by
taking the way I suggest. Were we all three
mounted the longer route would be of no account.&#8221;</p>

<p>The suggestion of selfishness was so obvious that
the Count found a direct answer inconvenient.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other would be impossible, then,&#8221; he
remarked curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now,&#8221; Von Tressen pursued, &#8220;as we two
are on foot and the Fr&auml;ulein has walked far, I feel
I ought to insist upon her taking the short cut.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka gave a scornful laugh. &#8220;You insist?&#8221;
Then he snarled, &#8220;I tell you there is no difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, Count, you are mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are somewhat presumptuous, Herr
Lieutenant,&#8221; Zarka flung back with a vicious flash
in his eyes, &#8220;to think to teach me my way about
the forest.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>All this time Philippa had remained silent; the
veiled altercation had been so rapidly carried on
as to give her scarcely an opportunity of interposing.
But now, when it was evident that neither
man would give way, and that a quarrel was imminent,
she spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us keep to the path. It is good of you,
Herr Lieutenant, to wish to spare me fatigue, but
I am not so very tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>The look she gave Von Tressen as she appealed
to him was such that he could no longer continue
to insist upon the shorter way. There was in it
entreaty and distress which, even putting aside his
love, he could not ignore. So, distasteful as it was
to yield to such an adversary, he could only bow
and acquiesce.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, the Fr&auml;ulein is the judge; we forget
that, Lieutenant,&#8221; Zarka observed, with a little
exulting laugh as they moved on again.</p>

<p>The talk was now not quite so easy. Zarka
addressed his whole conversation to Philippa, by his
manner ignoring Von Tressen altogether. It was
a great relief to her when the house was reached,
and at the gate she turned to her lover and bade
him farewell, the words she spoke and which Zarka
could hear being but an inconsiderable part of the
message which her eyes gave, and which that amiable
noble could not see. It was naturally most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
distasteful to Von Tressen to have to leave them
together, and he chafed at the idea that the Count
was free of the house while he remained an outsider;
but he told himself that for a week to come
he must bear it, and was too high-minded and
chivalrous to attempt to stay against Philippa&#8217;s
wish. But as he walked away, after exchanging
formal salutations with the Count, his mind began
again to dwell bitterly on the mystery which lay
between him and his love, and which he so longed
to bring to an end.</p>

<p>He was roused from thoughts which at every step
were becoming more tormenting, by the thud of a
cantering horse behind him. Feeling somewhat
happier in the knowledge that Zarka had not stayed
at the farm, he resolved not to turn or take any
notice of him, but to let him ride on, which doubtless
after what had passed between them, would be
the other&#8217;s intention. But it was not so. As he
drew level, Zarka reined in his horse, and addressed
Von Tressen in a sharp tone which was more of a
novelty than a surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like a few words with you, Herr
Lieutenant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at your service, Count,&#8221; he responded,
with as much show of indifference as he could
command.</p>

<p>&#8220;We need not stop,&#8221; Zarka proceeded, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
Lieutenant had halted and faced round. &#8220;What
I have to say,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;is a simple affair.
It is merely to warn you off forbidden ground.
You understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly.&#8221; The sternness of Von Tressen&#8217;s
face as he answered showed that he had at least a
suspicion of what the other was driving at. &#8220;I
should like to know where I have trespassed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am referring to Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg,&#8221; Zarka
said bluffly. The suave manner was gone, politeness
was a negligible factor now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kindly explain yourself, Count,&#8221; Von Tressen
said, with a touch of defiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; Zarka returned, with a confident
smile. To be forced to speak out was manifestly
nowise distasteful to him. &#8220;I have to request,
Lieutenant,&#8221; he proceeded in a sharp tone of
authority, &#8220;that you will discontinue your woodland
rambles with the Fr&auml;ulein.&#8221;</p>

<p>Von Tressen flushed hotly. &#8220;By what right,
do you make that demand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a perfect right to do so,&#8221; Zarka returned
coolly. &#8220;But for the moment it is enough that I
am commissioned by Herr Harlberg to convey this
request to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Herr Harlberg objects to my escort for his
daughter,&#8221; Von Tressen retorted warmly, &#8220;he
may tell me so himself. As for your demand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Count, I regard it as an insult. I am a soldier and
noble, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; Zarka interrupted with a deprecating
wave of the hand. &#8220;We need not go into
that. It is not the question. If you choose to
ignore the communication of Herr Harlberg&#8217;s
wishes, so be it. Now, Lieutenant, I have to inform
you that I object.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I. Aubray, Count Zarka.&#8221; The teeth were
showing now in the wolfish grin as he reined up
his horse, and the two men faced each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;On what ground, pray, Count Zarka?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lord of Rozsnyo gave a shrug of haughty
indifference. &#8220;Is it necessary to explain that&mdash;even
to you?&#8221; he asked with a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please.&#8221; The young man insisted sternly.</p>

<p>The Count met his look with a scornful smile.
&#8220;There can be but one reason. If you are so dense
that you cannot comprehend it, I must leave you
to find out. Only I have warned you, and you
will do well not to slight my warning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do as I please, Count,&#8221; Von Tressen
replied, longing to refute his suggestion by proclaiming
himself Philippa&#8217;s betrothed husband,
and yet restrained in honour from violating his
implied promise to her. &#8220;As a man of the world,
you must be aware that the Fr&auml;ulein herself is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
proper person to determine who her companion
shall be. And I shall certainly not avoid her society
unless she bids me do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; Zarka&#8217;s exclamation was not unlike a
bark. &#8220;If you do not take warning when it is
given you, my young friend, you may find yourself
in trouble&mdash;or worse.&#8221; There was an evil blaze in
the fierce eyes as he spoke, like the light in those
of a thwarted beast of prey. &#8220;My intention was
not to argue but to warn you off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; Von Tressen retorted, &#8220;have no intention
of submitting to any interference, even from
Count Zarka.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you defy me?&#8221; the Count cried, with an
ugly scowl.</p>

<p>Von Tressen smiled. &#8220;I hope there is no question
of defiance, Count,&#8221; he replied coolly. &#8220;But if
you mean to suggest that you expect me to be afraid
of you, I must ask you to excuse me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a bold fellow,&#8221; Zarka returned, with,
at any rate, the semblance of coolness. &#8220;No man
has ever yet successfully defied Aubray Zarka. If
you think it worth while to try to be an exception
do not blame me for the consequences. You do
not know my power. I have warned you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a soldier, Count,&#8221; Von Tressen rejoined
simply, &#8220;and my profession admits fear of nothing
but dishonour.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>&#8220;We shall see,&#8221; Zarka sneered, as he saluted and
rode on.</p>

<p>He had, before riding after Von Tressen, spoken
but a few hurried, darkly resentful words to Philippa,
judging, perhaps, that it was hardly a favourable
moment for making headway with his suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me thank you, Fr&auml;ulein,&#8221; he had said,
&#8220;for coming my way instead of the Lieutenant&#8217;s.
I hope you are not very tired?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am rather,&#8221; she answered coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; he said significantly, &#8220;your walk
was broken by a long rest, and doubtless a pleasant
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up bravely at the dark face bent
insinuatingly down to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;A long rest, Count?&#8221; she repeated, as though
not comprehending.</p>

<p>&#8220;Among the rocks,&#8221; he replied meaningly.</p>

<p>Then she knew for certain that the eyes that had
glared at her from between the rocks were those
of no wild animal, but of a being far more evil-minded
and quite as pitiless.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>THE SECRET ROOM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night Von Tressen and Galabin agreed to
make a determined attempt to solve the mystery
they had found at Rozsnyo.</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems no object in delay,&#8221; Galabin had
argued. &#8220;If the place is watched by Zarka&#8217;s
people, the patrol will continue as long as there is
any reason for it. No; our friend the Count is
certainly a highly suspicious character, and the
sooner one tries to find out something more about
him the better. For I cannot pretend that as yet
there is anything very tangible to report to Gersdorff.&#8221;</p>

<p>So after dark the two friends set out once more,
taking this time an indirect route so as to approach
Rozsnyo from the depth of the wood, not by the
customary path from the valley. Their object was,
naturally, to elude the vigilance of the man D&#8217;Alquen
whom they rather expected to find there, and whom
they imagined to be in some way connected with
Zarka and his proceedings.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>They made their way cautiously through the
darkness of the wood till they calculated they were
near the castle. With increased wariness they now
went forward, careful to give no sign of their approach
to any one who might be on the look-out.
A half-smothered exclamation from Galabin made
his companion start and look round on the alert,
Galabin pointed straight in front. Von Tressen
could see nothing; he crept to his friend&#8217;s side, and
so, coming within the same line of vision, saw plainly
what the trees before had intercepted. A light.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it should be from that mysterious window?&#8221;
Galabin whispered.</p>

<p>They went forward now quickly and silently,
anxious to get a nearer view of the light before it
should disappear. Quickly they came to the edge
of the wood. Yes; they were in luck. There,
in the midst of what was usually a dead, blank wall,
was the open window, and from it through the darkness
streamed evidence of a lighted room within.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick! Up into the tree!&#8221; Galabin urged
his companion in a whisper. Von Tressen was
already preparing to climb, and was soon hidden
in the branches. &#8220;At any rate the window has
stayed for him this time,&#8221; Galabin muttered to
himself, as he waited with eyes fixed on the light
which showed no sign of disappearing.</p>

<p>Presently a slight rustling above announced that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
the Lieutenant was descending. &#8220;Well?&#8221; Galabin
asked anxiously, as the other alighted beside him.</p>

<p>Von Tressen shook his head with a disappointed
look. &#8220;Nothing to be seen,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;One
can look into the window well enough; only a kind
of low screen runs before it, which effectually hides
everything but the cornice round the walls of the
room. But that it is a room, and that some one is
in it, I am certain, for once I saw a shadow move
along the wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure there is no chance of seeing who
is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Positively none at all; that is, from the tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The screen before the window makes it more
suspicious than ever,&#8221; Galabin observed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Assuredly it does. Especially as it seems,
so far as one could make out, a fixed affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Osbert,&#8221; Galabin said suddenly, &#8220;we are bound
to see what is behind. We must get to the bottom
of the mystery. And if we cannot see through
the window, we must get a sight from above.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible?&#8221; the Lieutenant asked doubtfully,
as he surveyed the high massive walls looming
black in front of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; Galabin answered. &#8220;I took the
liberty of reconnoitring the walls from the wood to-day,
as you know, and believe I have discovered a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
place where at least the attempt to scale them may
be made. But where is our inquisitive friend,
Herr D&#8217;Alquen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No sign of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not rely on that. Now let us keep
in the shadow thrown by this light, creep across
the dip as though he were watching for us, and so
make our way round the walls. I took the bearings
of the point where our chance seems to lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly they crossed stealthily to the walls,
and then made their way round with the utmost
caution till Galabin, who went first, made a sign
that the point he had indicated was reached. Here
the wall dropped considerably and was grown over
with ivy. It seemed a disused, half-ruinous, certainly
neglected, part of the building.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to be able to reach the top from here,&#8221;
Galabin whispered. &#8220;Whether it will be possible
to work our way along when we are up there is
another question, but in the daylight I could see
nothing to forbid it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate we will make a good attempt,&#8221;
replied Von Tressen, eager for the adventure.
&#8220;Let me go first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have brought a long strap with me,&#8221; Galabin
said, unbuckling it from his waist. &#8220;It may give
us just the help we want. Take it with you; you
are the better climber.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>Winding the stout strap round him, Von Tressen
began, without more ado, to work his way up the
ivy-grown wall. Noiselessness being imperative,
the business was not easy, especially as many of the
branches on the line of ascent were not strong enough
to bear a man&#8217;s weight. However, with some
difficulty he reached the top of the wall, and by the
aid of the strap Galabin was soon up beside him.
Then began a long crawl, not without danger, along
the uneven wall, which at that part formed a sort of
battlement rising to a considerable height above the
roof. Carefully feeling their way as they went,
the two were making steady though tedious progress
towards their goal when it was checked by a
sudden rise in the wall, of such a height and angle
that its ascent was almost impossible, certainly most
hazardous. Galabin had not failed to notice this,
but had scarcely realized what a bar to their attempt
it was likely to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot manage this,&#8221; Von Tressen said, after
standing up and examining the obstacle as well as
he could. &#8220;It would be sheer madness to attempt it,
at any rate until we have failed in every other way.
We must let ourselves down to the roof and try our
luck there. In any case we should hardly be able
to pass the tower.&#8221;</p>

<p>Promptly lowering himself till he hung from the
wall by his hands, he took hold of the strap and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
his companion let him slowly down. Galabin&#8217;s
own descent was naturally less easy; he had to
hang at arm&#8217;s length and so drop on to Von
Tressen&#8217;s shoulders, and had not the Lieutenant
been an athlete the feat might have had a disastrous
ending. However, the descent was accomplished
in safety, and now began their progress
along the edge of the roof under the parapet.
It occurred to them both they had been foolish not
to have tried that way from the first, since their
advance was easier and they were securely hidden
from any one who might be watching from outside.</p>

<p>A few yards on Von Tressen whispered back&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the light! You were right, Horaz.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had reached and were passing the tower
flanking the wall in which was the mysterious
window. The roof rose higher there, but a little
way above and beyond them was to be seen a hazy
brightness as rising from the skylight of a room
below. The climb to the higher roof presented
little difficulty, and as the two men reached it each
felt a thrill of excitement at the thought that the
solution of the mystery was now about to be theirs.
What were they going to look down upon? Noiselessly
now, with the utmost caution, they crept
forwards on hands and knees, nearer to the light,
nearer still, checking their impatience with the
thought that a slip or the slightest noise might mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
failure, and more, might cost them their reputations
if not their lives.</p>

<p>Foot by foot they drew themselves towards the
lighted roof, till at last they could make out how it
was contrived. Above the level rose an iron frame
about six inches high and perhaps ten feet square.
As they reached the structure they found it crossed
and recrossed by stout iron bars bolted to the frame,
and beneath there was a skylight of opaque glass.
So their curiosity was baffled, for, although a light
shone from the room below, it was impossible to
distinguish any object in it.</p>

<p>They held a whispered consultation.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not going to be beaten like this,&#8221; Von
Tressen said. &#8220;We must get a look down somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not so easy. The roof window had evidently
been constructed to guard not only against
admittance either way, but also against observation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only thing to do is to examine it closely,&#8221;
Galabin whispered. &#8220;We may find a peephole.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silently they crawled round the edge of the framework
examining every pane they could reach. All
to no purpose; the painted glass tantalizingly refused
to reveal the secret it covered. When they
had completed the circuit of the frame Galabin
suggested that he, as the lighter man, should venture
out on to the cross bars and try for better luck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
in the centre. This was not an easy task, especially
as it had to be effected without noise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care how you come back,&#8221; Von Tressen
warned him. &#8220;That will be the most difficult
part.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very slowly Galabin crawled out, snake-wise,
upon the bars, gently feeling, as he went, the glass
below each interstice. The Lieutenant watched
him anxiously, rather chafing at his own inaction.
Presently his attention was quickened as he became
aware that Galabin was resting longer than usual
over a certain square. Then as he anxiously watched,
he saw his companion raise his arm and motion him
to join him, but from the side running at right angles,
no doubt to distribute the strain on the bars. Von
Tressen at once began to crawl round and so towards
his companion, his eagerness being restrained only
by the warning hand which was still uplifted. It
did not take long, however, to bring their heads
close together, and Von Tressen could see that
Galabin&#8217;s search had been rewarded.</p>

<p>Almost in the centre of the skylight a pane of
glass was defective. It moved slightly in its leaden
casing, and one corner had either been left clear
through carelessness, or a scrap of the colouring
with which it had been covered had by some means
been removed. Anyhow there was left practically
a peephole through which nearly the whole of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
room beneath was clearly visible. Galabin raised
his head, and signed to Von Tressen to look down.</p>

<p>This is what he saw.</p>

<p>A fair-sized room, comfortably furnished, the
walls surrounded with heavy curtains, the floor
covered with a Turkey carpet. At one end the
curtains were looped back, showing an alcove in
which was a small bed. In the outer wall was also
an uncurtained space containing the mysterious
window, and before this ran the screen which had
prevented their seeing into the room. It was a
substantial affair of painted iron, which appeared
to be securely fastened to the wall by bars at either
end. In the room, at a table on which stood a
lamp, sat a man reading. His head was bent over
the book, and he seemed to be wearing some curious
kind of cap, but from his position it was not possible
to see his face. So he sat almost motionless, as the
two men by turns observed him, reading steadily
with one elbow resting on the table, his head on his
hand, while with the other he occasionally turned the
leaf.</p>

<p>For a long time they watched him, half fascinated,
for, apart from his surroundings, there was a suggestion
of strangeness and mystery about the figure.
Suddenly he closed the book and pushed it from
him, then threw up his hands, stretching back in an
attitude of weariness. As he did so Galabin, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
was at that moment in possession of the spy-hole,
started back in amazement. Von Tressen in wonder
looked through, and saw the cause of his action.
The man below in throwing up his head disclosed
a strange sight. For the face which the watchers
had expected to see was covered by a mask, a white
mask, bearing some resemblance to a ghastly
human face, and fastened on by the curious head-piece
which had puzzled them.</p>

<p>The man lay back in his chair with limbs stretched
out, and the hideous face upturned for several
minutes, during which the two men above watched
him in uncomfortable fascination. Presently he
sat upright, and turned his head towards the farther
end of the room. Although of course there was
a hideous absence of expression, yet the action was
one of expectancy. The curtains moved, then
parted, and a man came into the room, a short,
thick-set, determined-looking fellow, in Magyar
costume. He moved quickly across the room,
carrying a pistol in his hand. Taking from his
pocket a small winch he fitted it to a keyhole by the
window and turned it. As he did so the mystery
of its disappearance was solved, for, from the side
an iron shutter moved noiselessly across the window,
completely closing the aperture. This was, no
doubt, on the outside made to match the stone
wall, and so give no hint of an opening.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>Having returned the winch to his pocket, the
man went to the table and spoke a few words to the
masked prisoner, for such he evidently was. Whether
the other replied or not it was impossible for the
watchers to tell. The jailor then left the room,
and the prisoner, turning down the lamp, rose and
went towards the alcove where the bed stood. The
lamp flickered out, and only the faint flame of a
candle remained. Galabin touched his companion,
and withdrawing from the grating as silently as
they had come, they made their way back along
the roof, lowered themselves to the ground, and
reached the wood without incident.</p>

<small>A THREATENING PRESENCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning Count Zarka received a letter which
occasioned him a considerable amount of uneasiness.
It reached him by the hand of a peasant from the
mountain district, and its perusal caused the thin
lips to be drawn back, and the cruel teeth displayed
in a grin which was very far from suggesting pleasure.
Written by the man whom he had met at the
mountain inn, the letter contained very few words,
and those simply words of warning. But they
caused the noble Count to meditate deeply. For
he was playing a double game, and it presently
occurred to him that if the information hindered
him in one direction he might turn it to his advantage
in the other. So after a hurried breakfast he ordered
his horse and rode off towards the farm. He
did not take the shortest path though, but one
which led him past Von Tressen&#8217;s encampment.
With his inscrutable grin he gave the two friends
good morning, and made them wonder whether he
had found out anything of the night&#8217;s doings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
So they waited expectantly through his airy small-talk
for a clue to the real object of his visit, which
they felt sure was not paid for nothing.</p>

<p>They had not to wait long.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, talking of sport,&#8221; their amiable
visitor observed carelessly, &#8220;have you come across
another sportsman, almost as solitary as yourselves,
who haunts this part of the forest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Galabin, to whom Von Tressen
looked to reply; &#8220;there is a man who shoots about
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Zarka was still almost indifferent.
&#8220;I have heard of him but never seen him. A
dark, fierce-looking fellow, eh? A forbidding appearance,
I am told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not half as forbidding as some one I know,&#8221;
thought Galabin, but he said: &#8220;Dark certainly,
and rather fierce looking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know him? Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Slightly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; In spite of his patent indifference the
Count was becoming interested. &#8220;It is curious
that a man should wander about here in that
fashion. What is your idea of his object? Is he
really a sporting enthusiast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says so,&#8221; Galabin answered guardedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it is singular,&#8221; Zarka observed meditatively.
&#8220;You have seen much of him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>&#8220;No, very little. We asked him to join us at
luncheon one day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So! And what opinion did you form of the
mysterious one?&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin laughed, as much at their visitor&#8217;s curiosity
as the recollection of its object. &#8220;That he
was the most inquisitive person I had ever had the
honour to meet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count raised his eyebrows, and plunged
forward his head in surprise. &#8220;Inquisitive? About
sport?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So? A strange fellow, almost suspicious.
May I ask if so humble a person as myself had the
honour of awakening his curiosity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; Galabin answered pleasantly, &#8220;The
mysterious one asked several questions about you,
Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grin widened, as usual not with mirth.</p>

<p>&#8220;So? And doubtless about the only other
dwellers in these parts&mdash;our friends at the farm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A question or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Between scheming thought and an affectation
of amused indifference Zarka was a study.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am inclined to be suspicious of the man,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Did his questions seem merely prompted
by idle curiosity, or to have some intent behind
them?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>Galabin laughed; he was rather enjoying their
visitor&#8217;s uneasiness. &#8220;It is hard to say, Count,&#8221;
he answered slily, &#8220;since many people have a trick
of pretending to be less in earnest than they really
are. Certainly your friend seemed eager to know
all we could tell him, but that may have been the
effect of an exaggerated manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; Zarka replied, in a tone which showed
he hardly accepted the suggestion. &#8220;Did he tell
you his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He called himself D&#8217;Alquen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;D&#8217;Alquen?&#8221; The Count was evidently fixing
it in his memory. &#8220;Perhaps if I have the pleasure
of meeting Herr D&#8217;Alquen I may be able to satisfy
his curiosity on my own account.&#8221;</p>

<p>That there was an ugly threat behind his words
both his hearers agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; Von Tressen laughed, when their
visitor had departed, &#8220;what he would think of
our somewhat practical curiosity if he knew of
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin smiled grimly. &#8220;There would probably
be two vacancies forthwith in his Majesty&#8217;s service,
one in the civil department and one in the military.
The forest over which our gallant Count rules as
Obergespan would make an admirable <i>oubliette</i>:
no trace of either of us would be seen again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka rode on to the farm, and with the luck of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
which he often boasted met Philippa at a little
distance from the house. Perhaps the smile with
which he received her rather blank greeting was
occasioned by the idea that she was probably going
out to avoid his visit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not want to worry your father,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but I have a piece of bad news for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>With her insight into the man&#8217;s character, a
thrill of apprehension ran through her at the words.
True or not, she felt this was his first move in the
game against her, and if the bad news had its origin
in him alone, it was none the less to be dreaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked, striving bravely to
show no sign of alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are threatened by what I feared,&#8221; he answered,
taking from his pocket the letter he had
received that morning. &#8220;Read that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took it and read the few words it contained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Man who followed to inn dangerous. Tried
afterwards to rob me. On a peculiar track. Beware.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa looked up blankly. &#8220;I do not understand
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smiling mysteriously, Zarka held out his hand
for the paper. &#8220;Hardly,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;it is meant
to be obscure, since the sender, a trustworthy friend
of mine, did not know into whose hands it might
fall. But I will explain the meaning. It refers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
to a dangerous person who is just now haunting
the forest for no good purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A robber?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &#8220;Not a robber. The word
rob is used to mislead. What he really means is
that the man tried to get information out of him.
I was shooting in the mountains, and he was following
and watching me, as he is constantly watching
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And for the purpose hinted at here,&#8221; he
answered, tapping the letter. &#8220;You know the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>His identity had not occurred to her, but now she
realized who it must be. &#8220;The man who shot the
wild boar?&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka nodded. &#8220;No other. You guess his
purpose?&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa shook her head. He took a newspaper
from his pocket and pointed to a column devoted to
Prince Roel&#8217;s disappearance. She glanced at a few
lines of exaggerated language and then asked:
&#8220;Need I read all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not all,&#8221; he answered with a shrug. &#8220;But
at least a passage here which will explain the object
of my visit and my friend&#8217;s letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>He indicated a paragraph, and she read&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The theory that the unfortunate Prince&#8217;s
mysterious disappearance and much-to-be-feared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
death is attributable to an unhappy love affair, in
which he was made the victim of a lady&#8217;s caprice,
still holds ground, and it is terrible to think of the
dire results to which a woman&#8217;s thoughtlessness,
or worse, may lead. It is reported, although we
do not vouch for the truth of the news, that a near
kinsman and close friend of Prince Roel has left
Markaynar with the object of seeking out and
taking vengeance on those who may have been
responsible for his death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka watched her as she read, and as she came
to the end of the paragraph their eyes met. &#8220;You
understand now?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None other. You may be certain of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hardly needed his assurance, since D&#8217;Alquen&#8217;s
manner to her after the boar was killed was stronger
evidence than Zarka&#8217;s word. She recalled his strange
words and felt sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how comes he here?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>It was a question that Zarka found it inconvenient
to answer by more than a shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could he tell that I was here?&#8221; she went
on. &#8220;Why should he watch me? How connect
me with Prince Roel&#8217;s death?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy,&#8221; he replied, noting her rising fear,
&#8220;that he is not certain of your responsibility
or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He paused, still watching cat-like.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>&#8220;Or what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would not need to watch. He would
strike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman?&#8221; she exclaimed, betwixt fear and
indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You who know the man can tell better than I,&#8221;
he replied significantly. &#8220;I should say his notions
of chivalry are not exactly occidental.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the sooner we escape from
this place and go back to civilization and protection
the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had expected her to suggest that expedient,
and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Civilization and protection are scarcely synonymous
terms,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Are crime and lawlessness
confined to the mountains and forests? To return
to such a city as ours, nay, to seek refuge in any
capital in Europe would be to court, to facilitate
the blow. Wait one moment,&#8221; he continued, with
an abrupt change of tone. &#8220;I have a suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving his horse, he walked stealthily to the
edge of the clearing just beyond where they stood.
She followed him with her eyes, her mind full of
dark anxious thoughts. He turned and beckoned,
holding up his hand to warn her to come cautiously.
When she joined him he, without a word, leaned
forward and pointed. Above, on the brow of the
rising ground, on the outskirts of the wood, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
almost the very place where he had been accosted
by Von Tressen and Galabin, stood D&#8217;Alquen,
gun in hand, like a sentry, watching the farm.
After a glance at him Philippa drew back, and her
companion&#8217;s face said plainly, &#8220;Did I not tell you
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>For the moment her indignation got the better
of her fear. &#8220;What right has he to stand there
watching?&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;None,&#8221; Zarka replied. &#8220;He is the very genius
of suspicion. He watches to make sure.&#8221; His
tone was more curt and determined now. The
preamble was finished; the real business that he
had come about was to begin.</p>

<p>&#8220;To make sure?&#8221; Philippa returned. &#8220;Then
let him make sure&mdash;that I am entirely innocent of
Prince Roel&#8217;s fate, whatever it may be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka&#8217;s eyes, contradicting the smile, had the look
of a snake&#8217;s that is about to strike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he know the story of the roses, I wonder?&#8221;
he observed significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he does,&#8221; she returned, &#8220;he knows what, so
far as I am concerned, is false.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unhappily it is a story which is much more
easily shown to be true than proved false. But,&#8221;
he added, as his smile deepened, &#8220;I fancy we may
be sure he does not know it&mdash;yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>If she recognized the threat in the pause before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
the last word she chose to ignore it. &#8220;Why,&#8221; she
asked simply, &#8220;how is he likely to know it, then?
Hardly from you, Count?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boldness of her direct question for a moment
turned the point of his threat. &#8220;I think,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;that there is only one sure way of escaping that
fellow&#8217;s intention, whatever it may be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By letting Aubray Zarka be your protector.&#8221;</p>

<p>She met him with an innocent trick of his own
subtlety. &#8220;Why, surely, Count, I hope I may
expect you to defend me from a design which you
say threatens my life. You cannot think me so
ungenerous as to suppose you would refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was not taking it quite as he wished. &#8220;I
want you,&#8221; he urged, &#8220;to give me the right to
protect you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face clouded. &#8220;I cannot reverse the answer
I gave you yesterday,&#8221; she said firmly.</p>

<p>At last they were fairly in open conflict. He
pointed to where D&#8217;Alquen was standing. &#8220;You
prefer that to me; death to love?&#8221; he said, with
a gleam of thwarted passion in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love?&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;I have told you love
is out of the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; he rejoined, &#8220;it is well to love the
man who can protect you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>His urgency and want of consideration provoked
her. &#8220;Am I so helpless?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;More than you fancy,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;Perhaps,
you think,&#8221; he continued viciously, &#8220;this
dashing young Lieutenant can protect you. A
fool&#8217;s paradise, indeed! The whole of his regiment
would not keep that man&#8217;s knife or bullet from your
heart were he minded to drive it there. You do
not know the savage patience and determination of
these men. And your lover will doubtless share
your fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whatever her feelings were, she repressed them
and kept silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;One word,&#8221; he pleaded more vehemently as
he thought her yielding, &#8220;one little word, promising
to be my wife, and this awful danger shall pass from
you. I swear it! Yes; if I have to shoot that
mad fellow yonder with my own hand. I have
power here and men who live but to do my will,
men who would not hesitate at the risk of their lives
to sweep danger and fear from the path of their
queen and mistress. My wife! Philippa, you
cannot refuse. Give me but hope, and you shall
have an earnest that I am promising no more than
I can accomplish. That man, who in his mad
revenge seeks your life, shall never trouble you
again. Only tell me I may hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she shook her head. &#8220;I cannot,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
replied. &#8220;And were it possible for me to love you,
do you think I could consent to the death of the man
who saved my life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In order to reserve you for a worse fate,&#8221; he
sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That could hardly be,&#8221; she rejoined, &#8220;unless
it were to be the wife of a man I could not love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka&#8217;s face was dark now. &#8220;You can scarcely
expect him to ward off this danger in order that you
may marry a rival. A rival! Bah! I make no rival
of this flirting Lieutenant. Only&mdash;I tell you that
you shall not marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Philippa could utter the indignant words
that rose to her lips there was a sound of an approaching
presence. Owing to the peculiar deadening
effect of the wood, the steps were only heard
just as three men emerged into the path where Zarka
and Philippa stood. Both had looked round with
a start. The Count smiled, and Philippa flushed
with vexation as she recognized the three. They
were Von Tressen, Galabin and D&#8217;Alquen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>THE COUNT&#8217;S GAME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> afternoon, Abele D&#8217;Alquen, prowling about
the forest in his fiercely watchful mood, was
startled and brought up suddenly by the report
of a gun close behind him, and the sharp whizz of
a bullet so near as to touch his sleeve. He turned
with a loud exclamation of rage, and levelled his
gun at the direction whence the shot must have
come. His cry was returned by another of &#8220;Hold!
Do not shoot!&#8221; then there was a rustling in the
undergrowth, and next moment a man appeared, no
less a person than Count Zarka. Count Zarka, with
hand extended warningly, eyebrows elevated, and
a grin of concern and apology.</p>

<p>&#8220;A million pardons, mein Herr!&#8221; he cried,
coming eagerly forward. &#8220;I am too stupid.
Heaven be thanked that I missed you. I deserve
for my carelessness never to touch a gun again.
But I have been watching for a boar that has its
lair hereabouts, and I had no idea that any human
being but myself was within a league of the place.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>D&#8217;Alquen stood eyeing him, as he made these
effusive protests, with fierce incredulity. &#8220;It is
a strange idea of sport,&#8221; he said with manifest
restraint, &#8220;to fire at game before one sees it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count gave a shrug, and, with a sweep of the
arm, indicated the thick underwood around them.
&#8220;It is not easy to see here,&#8221; he returned, with a
deprecating grimace. &#8220;I took a chance shot at
what I thought was the animal before he should
come to close quarters. It was appallingly foolish
of me, I admit, and I am terribly distressed at
having brought you into such jeopardy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now it was perfectly obvious that no sane man
would have dreamt of shooting through brushwood
without a sight of the object fired at; more than
that, it would certainly be patent to a less suspicious
person than D&#8217;Alquen that the shot had been fired
not at a boar, but at himself, and with the intention
of getting rid of a dangerous presence. For a
moment he looked as though he were meditating
a return shot which would have rid the world of
one of its most singular devotees, but the impulse
was checked, and D&#8217;Alquen merely observed, keeping
alertly on the defensive, &#8220;One carries one&#8217;s life
in one&#8217;s hand here in the forest. It is as well not
to forget it. I shall profit by your wanting, mein
Herr: I might not escape a second time.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a significance enough, in all conscience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
in his words, but the Count found it convenient
to ignore it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only repeat,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;my most
heartfelt apologies already offered to you, mein
Herr. But for this truly unhappy occurrence, it
would have given me the greatest pleasure to have
asked you to join me in a day&#8217;s sport, and to have
made you free of my own preserved ground in the
forest. I am Count Zarka of Rozsnyo, and have
the honour to be always most humbly at your
service.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although perfectly aware that the other knew
well who he was, no one would have guessed as much
from his bland manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;As it is,&#8221; he proceeded, with a concern so well
simulated as nearly to hide the wolfishness beneath
it, &#8220;I am almost afraid to offer my hospitality after
my terrible carelessness. But if you will shoot with
me it will at least prove that my assurances are
accepted, and that I have your pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is hardly likely that D&#8217;Alquen was deceived
by this elaborate piece of dissimulation; all the
same, however, he, perhaps a good deal to Zarka&#8217;s
surprise, accepted the invitation, although not by
any means so cordially as to cover the fierce
distrust in his eyes. But then he was neither so
complete a man of the world nor so good an actor
as the Count, nor again had he such constant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
practice in giving expression to sentiments which
were the very opposite of his real feelings.</p>

<p>Zarka seemed, and probably was, immensely
relieved, as D&#8217;Alquen fell in with his proposal.
&#8220;Good!&#8221; he exclaimed, with an excess of almost
boisterous satisfaction. &#8220;You are truly kind and
forgiving, mein Herr. Now I shall hope to make
some slight atonement for my blunder by showing
you good sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without any corresponding cordiality in his face,
D&#8217;Alquen, with a sharp glance of suspicion, bowed,
shouldered his gun, and they set off together. Zarka,
chatting volubly, suggested that they should make
for the high ground and try for ibex, as affording
more interesting sport, and afterwards that his
companion should dine at Rozsnyo. So they strode
on shoulder to shoulder towards the mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;You come from far?&#8221; Zarka asked presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;From Sorusk, in the Province of Rapsburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count&#8217;s eyebrows went up in expressive
surprise. &#8220;Sorusk! that is indeed far. Ah, you
have lost your Prince. It is sad. What may be
the opinion in the province as to his disappearance?
That he is dead, poor fellow, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be the idea in the province,&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen
resumed, &#8220;but it is not mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Zarka was all polite curiosity. &#8220;You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
think he is alive? How, then, do you account for
his disappearance?&#8221;</p>

<p>Although the piercing eyes were on him the question
was asked in a tone and with an expression of
the blandest interest. For all sign of guilty knowledge
on his face Zarka might have had no greater
concern in the affair than the most casual lounger
on the K&ouml;nigstrasse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I account for it,&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen answered in his
abrupt fashion, &#8220;by an obvious move in the political
game played yonder.&#8221; He nodded towards the
mountains.</p>

<p>Zarka smiled incredulously. &#8220;A vague motive,
surely,&#8221; he objected. &#8220;I fancy that society in
town could furnish one far more probable.&#8221;</p>

<p>D&#8217;Alquen turned to him sharply. &#8220;And that
is&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka gave a shrug and smiled meaningly. &#8220;A
very common and obvious cause for a man&#8217;s eccentricity.
A lady. It is well known that Prince
Roel was smitten by one who, incomprehensibly
perhaps, did not return his admiration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know the lady&#8217;s name?&#8221; The question
was flashed out quickly, fiercely, only to be blunted
against the shield of Zarka&#8217;s inscrutable smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with any degree of certainty that would
justify my mentioning it,&#8221; was the guarded answer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>For a few steps they went on in silence. Then
D&#8217;Alquen resumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am aware there was a lady in the case. But
that does not disprove a political influence behind
the lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka deemed it enough to give a deprecating
shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; the other went on, as though irritated
by his companion&#8217;s non-committal manner, &#8220;she
may have been used as a decoy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not,&#8221; Zarka said coolly, &#8220;in a position
to contradict you, beyond saying that your theory
seems to me in the highest degree improbable.
After all,&#8221; here the teeth showed in an ugly grin
of deprecation, &#8220;after all we can but theorize, and
theorizing is unprofitable unless we have a practical
object in view.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I quite agree with you there, Count,&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen
returned, with a touch of curt significance.</p>

<p>As he spoke&mdash;something&mdash;a slight action of Zarka&#8217;s&mdash;made
him suddenly halt and look round quickly.
As he did so the Count altered the position of his
gun, but not before D&#8217;Alquen had seen that the
muzzle had been held a few inches from his head.
After that significant discovery D&#8217;Alquen never
let his eyes wander from his companion, although
he betrayed, and probably felt, no sign of fear.
Whether Zarka noticed the sharp observation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
under which he was kept it was impossible to tell
from his manner, but he was assuredly too acute
and watchful to be unaware of it.</p>

<p>Presently their ascending course brought them
to a wild and rocky opening in the forest. Zarka,
pointing in front of them, directed his companion&#8217;s
attention to a magnificent view of the glittering,
undulating range of the mountain&#8217;s tops. But
D&#8217;Alquen was too wary to be caught by what, to his
suspicious mood, seemed a trick. Before looking
in the indicated direction he stepped back, thus
bringing Zarka in front of him, and still under his eye.
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed with a grim laugh, hardly called
up by the scenery; &#8220;it is magnificent.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held his gun ready for bringing up on the
slightest provocative sign, and seemed rather to
enjoy the game of checkmating the Count&#8217;s amiable
moves. The ascending path now became too narrow
to allow of their walking abreast. Zarka stopped
and motioned his companion to precede him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Count,&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen said; &#8220;I follow you.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone was so decisive that Zarka evidently
saw the uselessness of pressing the matter. &#8220;I
shall have the honour of showing you the way,&#8221;
he said, covering his discomfiture with the politest
of grins.</p>

<p>So they wound their way up till the open mountain
plateaus were reached. Zarka now halted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
and turned with an affectation of breathlessness.</p>

<p>&#8220;We should soon get a sight of some game here,&#8221;
he observed. &#8220;We can now go forward together,
at least as far as the rocks yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed, as he spoke, to the base of some high
peaks which shut in the plateau.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had fine sport here with ibex and chamois,&#8221;
he remarked, as they walked on side by side,
D&#8217;Alquen ever on the alert, and amusingly distrustful
of his urbane and voluble companion.
&#8220;Two guns should, however, have a better chance
than one, since between us, up yonder, we can cut
off the animals&#8217; escape. It has been usually my
lot to hunt here alone, and many a good stag have
I lost through not having a comrade to get a second
shot on the retreat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The situation was certainly growing in grim interest;
either D&#8217;Alquen&#8217;s nerves were abnormally
strong, or he held the lord of Rozsnyo cheaper than
that potentate was wont to value himself. What
would the next move be? For certainly the stranger
had been brought up there for a purpose not altogether
connected with the slaying of ibex. Very
soon the man&#339;uvring for the plan, whatever it
might be, began. They had warily crossed the
plateau and readied another narrow path running
round the base of the rocky peaks. There was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
hesitation now about precedence. &#8220;May I show
you? Yes?&#8221; Zarka grinned and sprang up the
path. D&#8217;Alquen kept his gun handy and followed.
There was an equally curious, though less sinister,
smile on his face.</p>

<p>The Count led the way through a narrow passage
formed by a cleft in the rocks. The path was
rough and steep, but both men made light of its
difficulties. Suddenly they passed out on to the
side of a broad mountain gorge, high up on
which the path still ran, having on the one hand
a wall of rock, on the other sheer precipice. A
gleam of grim intelligence sprang into D&#8217;Alquen&#8217;s
eyes as he took in the situation. When they had
gone on perhaps a hundred paces, Zarka held up
his hand, halted and turned. D&#8217;Alquen had stopped
too, evidently ready for eventualities. But the
Count&#8217;s intentions seemed all for sport.</p>

<p>&#8220;Round the next shoulder,&#8221; he said in a low
voice, as he pointed forwards, &#8220;we shall probably
come upon ibex. I propose that one of us should go
forward while the other stays here, for the first shot
will probably send the rest of them back along the
opposite side, yonder, of the chasm. So there will
be a chance of two fine running shots. Now, will
you go forward, or shall I?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he had doubtless anticipated, D&#8217;Alquen answered
shortly&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;I will stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; Zarka returned with an acquiescent
bow. &#8220;After you hear my first shot,
it will pay to keep a sharp eye on the rocks over
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he went off along the path, to all
appearances absorbed in the sport. D&#8217;Alquen
stood with the sharp eye Zarka had advised fixed
steadily on the retreating figure and his gun ever
ready. &#8220;If he turns,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;I shall shoot,
and then&mdash;Heaven help the better man.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the wily Count did not turn or halt in his
stealthy pace along the rocky path. Perhaps he
had a shrewd idea that such a notion might be
attended with a certain risk. So he continued to
steal on, in true stalker&#8217;s fashion, till a curve hid
him from sight.</p>

<p>Then D&#8217;Alquen was at liberty to turn and survey
his situation. It was simple enough. On each
side of him was the narrow path, in front the precipice,
and behind him a wall or rock some thirty
feet high. Now what was Zarka&#8217;s game? Not
ibex; D&#8217;Alquen laughed aloud at the idea. What
should he himself do? Clearly not stay there,
since that was what the Count expected. He must
either retreat by the way they had come or go forwards.
He certainly would not turn back; the
game was interesting enough to provoke him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
follow his worthy guide, so, after, another good look
round, he went slowly on.</p>

<p>He came to the bend, round which Zarka had
disappeared, without seeing anything to quicken
his alertness into action. As he rounded the turn,
however, his vigilance increased, and every step
was taken with caution.</p>

<p>No sign of Zarka was to be seen, although the
path was visible for a considerable distance ahead,
and this was the more remarkable as away on the
right the forms of several ibex were to be observed.
Was Zarka stalking them in hiding? That was
scarcely possible, since the course he must have
taken afforded no chance of concealment. On
D&#8217;Alquen crept, his gun almost at his shoulder, and
his fierce restless eyes taking in everything round
and above him. Suddenly he stopped with a subdued
exclamation. The mystery was solved.</p>

<p>He had arrived at a point where a deep fissure in
the rocky wall opened upon the path at such a sharp
angle as to be invisible from the side of his approach
till he was fairly opposite to it. Through this
cleft a sort of rugged path ran back, as it seemed,
behind the rock, the face of which he had just
skirted. Doubtless Zarka had doubled back by
this means. D&#8217;Alquen hesitated a moment. The
narrow way might be a complete death-trap set
by the cunning man, who had calculated that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
intended victim would follow him. D&#8217;Alquen gave
another look round, and then seemed resolved to
risk it. With his gun ready to fire he sprang up
the path and made his way quickly along it. The
few seconds it took him to reach the other end of the
defile were calculated to make his blood tingle,
since he would have been practically at the mercy
of a raking shot from above. However he emerged
upon the open without this experience, and in another
instant his quick eye had detected what it
sought, the form of Count Zarka creeping stealthily
along the top of the rocks. Keeping well down,
and so out of sight, D&#8217;Alquen immediately began
to follow. When he had gone, as he judged, far
enough, he turned and began to crawl upwards,
stalking the Count with more than a sportsman&#8217;s
wariness and zest. Zarka was evidently so intent
upon his design that he never glanced behind, at
any rate while D&#8217;Alquen was in sight. The way
he was taking would bring him to the edge of the
rocks above the spot where he supposed the other
to be waiting, and as his intended victim realized
the treacherous scheme a light gleamed in his eyes
that boded mischief for the Count. So he followed
him, keeping as much as possible under cover of the
rocks, stooping as he ran, sometimes crawling, from
one shelter to another; ever, when he was exposed,
keeping his enemy covered by his gun.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>But now Zarka had reached the edge of the rocky
wall and stepped cautiously to the very brink with
his gun ready to fire down upon the path below.
D&#8217;Alquen, watching him from behind a jutting
rock, laughed, and, walking quietly into the open
ground, made quickly towards him. The Count
looked up and down the path below; the other
thought he heard an exclamation of annoyance from
him as he found himself baulked in his benevolent
design. Zarka peered over; the temptation to put
a bullet through him must have been almost irresistible,
but D&#8217;Alquen did not pull the trigger of
his covering gun. There was now a look of grim
amusement in his eyes; having the game in hand,
he was evidently loath to spoil it. Zarka drew
back, then lay face downwards looking over the
rocky wall. D&#8217;Alquen gave a little run and came
within half a dozen paces of him. With another
utterance of disgust Zarka rose to his feet, and,
naturally, turned, to find himself covered by D&#8217;Alquen&#8217;s
rifle.</p>

<p>Before he could get up his own weapon the
other cried: &#8220;Drop it! Throw your gun over,
or I fire. Over with it, I say, or you are a dead
man!&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka&#8217;s face had gone grey, his eyes blazed with
impotent hate. By a great effort he assumed a look
of surprised protest, but his ever-ready smile was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
hardly a success, if, that is, it was meant for anything
more than a diabolical grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr D&#8217;Alquen!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What do you
mean, my good friend? Are you mad?&#8221;</p>

<p>But his good friend showed no sign of relaxing
his attitude. &#8220;Drop your gun over, or I swear I&#8217;ll
shoot,&#8221; he insisted.</p>

<p>The Count hesitated, and for a moment looked
as though he were calculating his chances in an
impromptu duel. But D&#8217;Alquen&#8217;s rifle covered him
pitilessly; he could see that the aim was straight
on his heart. Probably his wonder was that his
intended victim had not fired without parley.
After all, his opportunity was lost, and to lose his gun
was to gain time. So with a protesting shrug he
turned and threw the weapon ringing down the rocks
below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you satisfied, mein Herr?&#8221; he demanded,
with almost insolent blandness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly, Herr Graf,&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen returned. &#8220;But
that is something. It was lucky I did not wait
for the stags, or my patience would have been
exhausted. You did not mention that another
matter claimed your attention first.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s mocking tone was not pleasant to the
lord of Rozsnyo, possibly because it was precisely
what he would himself have been pleased to indulge
in had the tables been turned. However, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
forced to content himself with a remark, rather
weak, considering the intensity of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not aware that I had come out for sport
with a madman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I was that my companion was an assassin,&#8221;
D&#8217;Alquen retorted. &#8220;Now, Herr Graf, shall I
send you after your gun?&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he levelled his rifle again full at
Zarka. The Count was not lacking in courage,
or at least in a gambler&#8217;s recklessness, nevertheless
a look of something very like the terror of death
spread over his grey face. He threw out his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoot me if you will, madman,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I
am unarmed and at your mercy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words may have been spoken almost at
random, or he may have shrewdly felt that his adversary
was a man of honour, of instincts very
different from his own. Anyhow he could scarcely
have hit upon a speech more to the point. D&#8217;Alquen
did not fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be sorry to cut short an interesting
career,&#8221; he said with almost savage mockery, &#8220;or
to anticipate its more formal and judicial ending.
You undertook to show me some sport, Herr Graf,
and I cannot deny that you have fulfilled your
promise. You were right; it is much more interesting
with two guns than one, and I am sorry that
in your ardour for sport you have lost yours. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
we must accept the fortune of the chase, and when
we hunt big game we cannot have it all our own way.
Now, as I have far to go, I must do myself the honour
of bidding you good-day, with thanks for an entertaining
afternoon. I fear I cannot trespass upon
your hospitality at Rozsnyo, having already experienced
my full share of it here. I should be
afraid of putting your good nature and patience
to too severe a test. Count, I have the honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>He touched his hat and, with a mocking bow,
turned and strode off down the rocks, leaving Zarka
standing there the picture of baffled malignity and
speechless rage.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>A LIGHT IN THE FOREST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Philippa</span> spent the rest of that day in a state of
anxious indecision. Everything seemed against
her. On all sides danger threatened, and her situation
was made doubly distressing from the knowledge
that there was no one with whom she could
take counsel. Her lover, Von Tressen, would be
ready enough to advise and protect her, but somehow
she shrank from giving him the necessary
explanation of her presence in that out-of-the-way
region, and her intimacy with Zarka. The thought
that they had been seen together in the forest alley
filled her with angry shame; she longed for an opportunity
of explaining her confidential relations with
the Count, yet in the first flush of her love she dared
not. What, she asked herself, would Von Tressen
think of finding her there with the man she professed
to fear and hate? Chance itself seemed to
have joined her enemies; if only she had some
friend from whom she could frankly seek advice.
Her step-father, she felt, was absolutely untrustworthy;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
selfish and indifferent, he would be only
too glad to play into Zarka&#8217;s hands. No. She
must go through the fight single-handed, unless
she could bring herself to call Von Tressen to her
aid. Zarka had left her that morning, after the
three men had passed, as her open and declared
enemy, for she had remained firm in her rejection
of his suit. His was one of those positive characters
which gather strength from opposition:
the blood of half savage, turbulent ancestors ran
in his veins; his courtly manner was but an assumed
mask, behind which was a strong, unscrupulous,
vindictive will. Sooner than admit the success of
a rival, he was capable, Philippa felt sure, of betraying
her to D&#8217;Alquen. Ah, there was danger indeed,
when once that fanatical avenger had resolved
to strike. Towards sunset she had looked out and
fancied she saw the man again watching the farm
from his post of observation on the hill. It was
horrible in that lonely region to be ever under that
wild malignant eye, never knowing when the blow
the watcher meditated might fall. Then a maddening
thought came to her. What if this man had
slandered her to Von Tressen? How much did he
know? What tale might he not have told? The
Lieutenant had not been to the farm that day. Why
was that? Yesterday&#8217;s avowal of love should have
brought him to her; and yet a whole day had passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
and, but for that chance unfortunate <i>rencontre</i>, she
had seen nothing of him. Everything seemed
in a vortex of doubt and danger. It was more than
Philippa could bear, and at last she resolved that,
come what might, she would make a bold effort
to see her lover without delay. Might not he be in
danger too? Zarka had boasted of his power, and
of his unscrupulous people. If he could put one
man out of the way, why not another? Yes, she
would seek Von Tressen at all hazards.</p>

<p>Once her resolve taken she waited impatiently
for nightfall, for it was under cover of darkness
that she judged it safest to make her way to the
encampment. Then, giving the excuse of a headache
she bade her step-father good-night, and went
to her room, whence she easily slipped out of the
house unobserved. She knew pretty well the direction
in which the encampment lay; it was not far
off, but the night was dark and thundery, and her
progress was naturally slow. But she never hesitated
or faltered, although the oppressive gloom and
silence of the forest, the thought of danger from
man or beast, might well have made her nerves play
the traitor. On she went steadily, warily, threading
her way through the great trees, on and on without
a thought but of her purpose, for her situation had
made her almost reckless save of one thing, the
danger of losing her lover.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>She had gone a good distance when the disquieting
idea came to her that she had missed her
way. The darkness was so impenetrable that it
was almost impossible for her to tell in which direction
she was going; she had boldly set out and held
her course in a straight line, but now she suddenly
realized that in that black mass of trees to follow
a direct route was, certainly to her inexperience,
almost impracticable. For a moment the danger
of being lost in the forest rose to her mind; then she
beat the thought down, and went on resolutely,
trusting that chance would bring her safely to her
destination. But chance was not her friend that
day.</p>

<p>She calculated that, had she gone direct to the
encampment, she must by that time have reached it.
So she had evidently missed her way. There was
nothing to be done but to keep on, in the hope of
lighting upon the camp, since to attempt to retrace
her steps would be futile. So she persevered for
a while, but all to no purpose. She seemed only
to get more hopelessly lost. Becoming desperate
at length, and her fears beginning to rise now that
her purpose seemed frustrated, she determined as a
last resort to try and strike into the valley. Once
there she could at least find her way home without
much difficulty.</p>

<p>It must lie on her right hand, she thought, so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
turning in that direction, she set off once more
through the black wood.</p>

<p>Happily the guess at her bearings was correct.
Ten minutes of rough groping brought her, greatly
to her relief, to the end of the trees on that side
of the valley and to clear ground. Here progress
was comparatively easy, and the darkness not so
paralyzing. As she stood debating whether she
should make her way up the valley to the Grange
and thence try the path again, or attempt to find
her way direct to the encampment, she saw before
her at some distance a light. It was very small and
lasted but a moment or two, like the striking of a
match. Was it some one lighting a cigar? she
thought. Von Tressen, perhaps, or Count Zarka?
If only it were the Lieutenant. It was not unlikely.
The spirit of reckless adventure was on her, and she
resolved to go forward and see. So she ran cautiously
towards the point whence the light had shone,
slackening her pace as she calculated she must be
near it, and creeping along so as not to attract
attention. Presently she stopped and listened.
She was certain she heard men&#8217;s voices, and fancied
she recognized Von Tressen&#8217;s. She quickly followed
the sound, but progress now was not so easy; the
ground rose steeply on the other side of the narrow
valley and the wood was thick again. Still she
pressed on, with many a stumble, encouraged by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
the thought that her lover was so near. Soon the
wood became as dark and bewildering as that from
which she had lately escaped. Still up and up the
girl panted, hoping every moment to hear the welcome
voice again, but, though she often stopped
to listen, she could not be certain that she heard it.
Suddenly a strange phenomenon rose before her
sight; the forest, thick as it was, seemed now to
present a great, black, impassable wall. Philippa
stopped in amazement. Then, as the air grew
lighter, the explanation flashed upon her. The
great black mass in front of her was not wood but
stone; she was outside Rozsnyo.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Philippa realized her whereabouts
when she saw a dark object moving in the obscurity
a few yards away. She was now standing by the
slope of the dry moat. Instinctively she crouched
down beside one of the shrubs with which it was
planted. The moving figure was a man. He came
slowly on, passed close to where she was hidden,
and so disappeared in the darkness. But an uncontrollable
fascination had made her look up in
spite of her fear as he passed, and she recognized
him even under those conditions. It was D&#8217;Alquen.</p>

<small>FROM FURY TO FURY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> danger of her situation flashed upon her. It
was this man, then, who must have struck the light
she had seen. What an escape she had had. If
he found her there alone would not so apt an opportunity
overcome any hesitation in his mind? He
would kill her, if only for the impunity with which
the deed might be done. Her one thought now
was to escape, but how? D&#8217;Alquen had cut her
off from the valley; she dared not venture into the
wood which lay between it and the castle for fear
of encountering him. As she crouched there,
fearful of the man&#8217;s return, desperately reviewing
her chances of escape, a vivid flash of lightning,
accompanied almost simultaneously by a crashing
peal of thunder, announced that the threatened
storm had burst over Rozsnyo. In panic the girl
rose and fled across to the shelter of the wall, and
shrank against it, panting and terrified. The rain
now poured down in a deluge, the lightning played
round her in almost incessant flashes, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
thunder pealed deafeningly. It was a typical
mountain storm of the fiercest kind. Driven both
by fear and the pelting rain from the inadequate
protection of the bare wall, Philippa looked round
in desperation, and seeing what seemed a sheltering
buttress at some little distance, made a rush for it.
Even this provided but a poor screen against the
storm&#8217;s fury; a blinding flash seemed to strike the
ground but a few feet from the place, and in terror
Philippa abandoned her position and ran on, seeking
a safer refuge. To her intense relief she came
to a deeply recessed doorway, and in this at last
she found complete shelter. Here she stayed,
recovering from her fright, until the violence of the
downpour abated, and she could think of venturing
upon her return. A short way from where she stood
a bridge spanned the hollow, and seemed to lead
to a path through the woodland beyond. To adventure
upon it was risky, yet to stay where she
was would be to court falling into Zarka&#8217;s hands,
and of the two she felt she feared D&#8217;Alquen the less.
The rain had now nearly ceased, although the darkness,
save for an occasional flash, was as great as
ever. After some hesitation Philippa resolved to
make a run for it and trust to chance to find her
way home again. Gathering her skirts round her
she ran to the bridge, just discernible in the night&#8217;s
blackness. She was half way across it when a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
flash lighted up for a second the open space against
the dark background of the wood, and showed her
two men on its outskirts, Von Tressen and Galabin.</p>

<p>Philippa&#8217;s first impulse was to call to them and
run forward. Her second thought checked this,
and made her crouch beneath the railing of the
bridge, then turn and retreat to the walls again.
If her lover found her there what would he think?
How could she account for her presence? Easily
enough&mdash;and yet&mdash;. Coupled with the mystery
of her relations with Zarka, how could she expect
that Von Tressen&#8217;s mind would not be full of suspicion?
Here she was, coming from the Count&#8217;s
very door, and her poor excuse was that she had
lost her way and been frightened. After having
been surprised in that equivocal situation with him
that morning she dared not add this compromising
evidence to the doubt she felt sure must be in her
lover&#8217;s mind. No; she must wait till the path was
clear. Her life&#8217;s happiness was at stake, and Fate
was cruelly her foe just then.</p>

<p>So she went back to the doorway, where she could
stay securely hidden in its recess without fear of
betrayal from a chance flash of lightning. Here
she waited for a while, and then, just as she was
preparing to set out again, she felt with a thrill of
terror that a hand grasped her arm, and a voice
said in her ear&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>&#8220;So! I have caught you!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a terrible start Philippa turned. The
small, iron-studded door behind her had opened
silently, and a woman stood there. Philippa could
just see the flash of her eyes; the nervous vicious
clutch on her arm told her that the presence was
not a friendly one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came here for shelter,&#8221; she began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shelter!&#8221; There was a bitter laugh in the
voice that echoed the word. &#8220;Shelter?&#8221; it repeated.
&#8220;Yes; you shall have shelter. Come
in!&#8221;</p>

<p>The grip on her arm pulled her towards the door,
but she resisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; she replied, trying to release
herself. &#8220;The storm is now nearly over. I will
find my way home.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the hands held her strongly. &#8220;Not yet,&#8221; her
captor returned. &#8220;You must come in, I have
something to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa was now almost within the doorway.
&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; she demanded, with an
effort to keep under her agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; replied the other, &#8220;and I will tell
you. It is useless to resist. I could kill you where
you stand if I chose.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were hissed out in the very boiling
heat of passion. Bewildered and frightened, yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
conscious of no offence, Philippa had suffered herself
to be drawn a foot or two over the threshold. By
a quick movement the other woman contrived to
close the door, which shut noiselessly as though
protected from banging. &#8220;Come with me,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;I must speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was pitch dark, but the grip on Philippa&#8217;s
arm, which never relaxed, guided her along what
seemed to be a passage, till a sudden turn brought
them to a stop. Then her arm was released, and
the other&#8217;s voice said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay, till I strike a light.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next moment a match blazed and a candle was
lighted. It showed to Philippa&#8217;s look of anxious,
breathless wonder a small oak-panelled room and
the form of a girl like herself, the dark, resentful
face of Royda d&#8217;Ivady.</p>

<p>As the candle burnt up Royda raised her head,
meeting Philippa&#8217;s gaze defiantly. So for some
moments the two stood eyeing each other in silence,
but with very different expressions.</p>

<p>At length Royda spoke. &#8220;You know me,
Philippa Harlberg?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;you are Fr&auml;ulein
d&#8217;Ivady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right,&#8221; Royda said with a sneer,
&#8220;and I think I could make an equally good guess
as to why you are here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>The girl, it was evident, was wild with rage, which
only by a great effort she kept from bursting forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have you brought me here?&#8221; Philippa
said, with a calmness in strange contrast to the
other&#8217;s excitement. &#8220;I should like to know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You expected some one else to open the door,&#8221;
Royda said, in a voice which passion rendered
scarcely audible.</p>

<p>If Philippa understood the taunt she ignored it.
&#8220;I did not expect the door to open at all,&#8221; she
returned quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Royda burst out, no longer able to
repress the passion that shook her. &#8220;Not by your
lover, Aubray Zarka?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lover?&#8221; Philippa dashed out. &#8220;Count
Zarka is very far from being my lover.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why are you here?&#8221; Royda hissed rather
than spoke. &#8220;Why did I see you creeping like a
thief across the bridge? Yes; like a thief, a
thief, as you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ran into the doorway for shelter from the
storm,&#8221; Philippa replied, meeting the other&#8217;s
violence with dignity, yet conscious of her false
position.</p>

<p>&#8220;The storm?&#8221; Royda laughed mockingly.
&#8220;Does that account for Rozsnyo being your nearest
place of shelter? It is a long evening stroll for a
young lady from Gorla&#8217;s farm.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>&#8220;Your suspicions,&#8221; Philippa said, repressing the
indignation she felt at Royda&#8217;s manner, which was
more insulting than her words, &#8220;are altogether
wrong and most unjust. I lost my way in the forest
before the storm began. I had no thought of coming
here, much less a wish to see Count Zarka. I hate
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Royda looked at her without
speaking. Such a look it was. Her eyes seemed
to contract and coruscate with spite and rancour.</p>

<p>&#8220;You hate him!&#8221; she repeated slowly. &#8220;You
hate him? Is that why he visits you every day?
Why I find you here at his private door? Lucky
the flash of lightning showed you to me before he
saw you. Aubray will hardly expect you in this
storm,&#8221; she continued mockingly. &#8220;He does not
suspect what danger his dear Philippa would brave
for his sake. But you are not at the end of your
dangers yet, madame, let me tell you that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa&#8217;s patience was exhausted, besides which
she feared that any moment might bring Zarka
upon the scene. She comprehended the jealousy
of this angry girl, and cared little for her fury, but
the other danger made her sick with fear and impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have listened to you long enough,&#8221; she said
haughtily. &#8220;If you do not accept my explanation,
I cannot help it. I can stay no longer.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>As she moved to the door Royda sprang forward
and reached it first. Then turned to Philippa, her
dark face livid with hate and passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall go,&#8221; she said in a low voice. &#8220;I
will show you the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the light, opened the door and went
out, motioning Philippa to follow her. They
traversed several softly carpeted passages, and at
length arrived at a great door. Royda turned
the handle and it opened noiselessly, disclosing,
not, as Philippa expected, the open air, but the
broad flight of steps leading down into the rock.
She drew back. &#8220;That is not the way,&#8221; she said,
full of suspicion and fear of a trap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the way you came in,&#8221; Royda replied
sharply under her breath. &#8220;It is a private
passage out of the castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dark, grim, rock-hewn stairway was not
inviting, especially when dimly seen by the light
of a solitary candle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not go down there,&#8221; Philippa said.</p>

<p>Royda stood eyeing her in resentful impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she sneered. &#8220;You would doubtless
rather take your departure by a more open way that
Aubray Zarka might catch sight of you. This
is the only outlet for you. Fool! What are you
afraid of? I will go first. Now, come!&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa felt that almost any risk was preferable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
to that of encountering Zarka, and at least she
might trust this jealous girl to keep her from that.
So, after a moment&#8217;s hesitation, she followed Royda
warily, resolved to be on the alert for a trick.</p>

<p>The descent into the rock was not reassuring,
but Philippa by an effort kept up her courage,
feeling herself, at any rate physically, a match for
her guide. At length the end was reached, and the
great door of the armoury pushed open. As she
saw the immense room with its rows of ghostly
mailed figures Philippa started in horrible fear and
stopped on the threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is this? What is in there?&#8221; she
demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not be afraid,&#8221; Royda answered,
with a touch of exultant scorn at her rival&#8217;s terror.
&#8220;It is only the armoury. We are in the heart of
the rock. But there is a passage from here leading
out into the valley. I will show you.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in her manner, the indication
of a set purpose, which made Philippa doubt
whether her intention was merely to get rid of her.
On a table near the door stood a set of candelabra,
a portion of those used when the great room was
lighted up. Royda, from the candle she carried,
set herself to light some of these. The action struck
Philippa as suspicious. &#8220;Why are you doing
that?&#8221; she asked apprehensively.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>&#8220;In case this little one should go out by accident,&#8221;
was the ready answer, given without looking at her
questioner. &#8220;We should never find our way then
in this great dark place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The explanation was plausible enough, Philippa
thought, as she glanced round the room and the
labyrinth of its contents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; Royda said, as she set down the candle
she had carried and closed the door. Then she
turned again to Philippa and, without warning of
her intention, dealt her a swift, vicious blow in the
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Philippa caught her arm, but Royda,
struggling like a wild animal, freed herself and
sprang back out of reach.</p>

<p>For a few seconds neither spoke, but they stood
eyeing each other, Royda in the momentary ebb
preparatory to the next dash of her fury, Philippa
in astonished anger, not unmixed with relief at this
declaration of the other&#8217;s intention.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; she demanded
indignantly.</p>

<p>With the breaking of the pause, Royda&#8217;s passion
blazed forth at last without restraint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mean? I mean that I hate you, vile thief
and trickster. I thank you for coming here to-night,
for you shall give me satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Satisfaction?&#8221; Philippa repeated, almost inclined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
to laugh at the girls&#8217; exhibition of fury.
&#8220;For what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what?&#8221; Royda burst out. &#8220;For having&mdash;ah,
that I should live to say it&mdash;for having robbed
me of my lover. You, who think your power so
great that you can play with hearts as you like.
I know now it was you who sent Prince Roel to
his death. I have found that out, and Aubray is
fool enough to admire you. He shall not admire
you long. Yes; I thank Heaven for its lightning
that betrayed you to me to-night. You shall not
have come to Rozsnyo for nothing! May be you
have found your match at last, Philippa Harlberg,
if that is your name and not another of your lies.
At least we will try which is the better woman in
another way, where lying shall not serve. Look!&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced round quickly, then ran to a stand
and snatched from it two light rapiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; she cried, trembling with excitement.
&#8220;They are both exactly the same length. There
is yours!&#8221;</p>

<small>IN THE DEPTH OF THE ROCK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> threw one down at Philippa&#8217;s feet. But the
other made no suggestion of taking it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense! What madness!&#8221; she exclaimed
indignantly. &#8220;Please show me the way
and let me go. I have had enough of this place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not till I please,&#8221; Royda flung back. &#8220;You
shall never go, if I can help it, for I mean to try
to kill you. I tell you,&#8221; she went on, in an access
of fury provoked by Philippa&#8217;s calmness, &#8220;you shall
fight. If men can, why not we? I have no skill
in fence, so we may be equal there, unless you have,
and even then I am content. No one will interrupt
us here. I am not one of your cold blood. You
have crossed my love, ruined my life, and must take
the consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If,&#8221; Philippa returned, with a touch of haughtiness,
&#8220;as you say, I am cold-blooded, you will
understand my refusing anything so ridiculous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
as a duel. And, apart from its absurdity, I have
no feeling against you or wish to hurt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you take my blow and will not resent it,
coward that you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can make allowances for your excitement,&#8221;
Philippa replied calmly, &#8220;and the error into which
it has led you concerning my presence here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Royda retorted scornfully. &#8220;You
are very kind, so kind that your kindness is an insult.
You shall fight me, Philippa Harlberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you shall. Or at least I will fight you,
and if you do not choose to defend yourself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa looked at the girl standing before her
in the white heat of passion, impatiently bending
the light rapier in her hands. The situation was
absurd and yet serious. Philippa had quite her
sex&#8217;s share of courage when it came to the point
of action, but she felt utterly nonplussed by the
extraordinary turn the night&#8217;s events had taken.
She was practically a prisoner, alone with a girl
whose naturally excitable nature was inflamed
almost to madness against her.</p>

<p>&#8220;A duel is ridiculous, monstrous,&#8221; she protested.
&#8220;I am ready to give you any other satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What satisfaction?&#8221; Royda broke in passionately.
&#8220;When two men love the same woman they
fight. When two women love the same man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>&#8220;But we do not,&#8221; Philippa interrupted. &#8220;I
hate him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Royda gave an incredulous laugh. &#8220;You hate
Aubray Zarka? Well, then one of us loves him
and he loves the other. That is enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he won&#8217;t care for you I am to fight
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Royda answered savagely between her
teeth, as though slung by the taunt, pushing with
the point of her sword the other on the floor towards
Philippa.</p>

<p>&#8220;I absolutely refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are a coward. As cowardly as you
are treacherous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least I am not a romantic fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I am?&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa gave a shrug and turned away, weary
of the scene. Instantly she heard a quick movement
behind her and felt across her shoulders the sharp
sting of a blow. Turning she found Royda close
behind her with rapier uplifted in the act of striking
her again. Her first impulse was to rush at her
assailant and try to disarm her, but Royda, anticipating
this, sprang back a pace and levelled
the point of her weapon at her breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Coward! You shall fight me, or I will kill
you! Take up that sword and defend yourself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>&#8220;I am no coward,&#8221; Philippa retorted. &#8220;You
say you have no knowledge of fence. I have. I
used to practice it in town. A contest between
us would not be equal, and I have no desire&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I care nothing for that,&#8221; Royda broke in impatiently.
&#8220;Nor for your advantage in being
taller and having a longer reach. I mean to fight
you. At least I cannot come off worse than I stand
now, and it will be some sort of satisfaction. Now
will you take that sword? You shall!&#8221; For
Philippa had made an impatient gesture. &#8220;The
world has not room for us both.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you again it is monstrous,&#8221; Philippa
insisted, regaining her composure. &#8220;I have no
wish to touch you. How have you harmed
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Royda was calmer now, but her determination
was none the less keen and unshakable. &#8220;That
is nothing in affairs of honour,&#8221; she returned impatiently.
&#8220;There is seldom grievance on both
sides. But to prick that bubble of excuse&mdash;have
I not given you two blows? Refuse to fight me
and I will utterly ruin and disgrace you. I will
proclaim Aubray Zarka as your lover; I can easily
prove your secret visit here to-night, and the world
shall know it. You have come here as a thief
and must take the consequences. You cannot
escape except to absolute shame. I will talk no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
more. I hate you. If you do not take up that
sword I swear I will run you through the
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was in earnest, and Philippa could but
realize the helpless position she was in. Escape
was impossible. At night in that strange place,
deep in the centre of the rock, from which she knew
no way of escape, under the very roof of her dreaded
lover, Zarka, there was nothing to do but to face her
enemy. Expostulation was clearly useless before
the fury of the jealous girl, and Philippa felt that
she must act. She stooped and took up the rapier,
and as she did so Royda drew a great breath of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is good!&#8221; she said between her teeth, and,
leaning her own weapon against the nearest stand
of armour, proceeded to divest herself of the upper
portion of her dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better do the same,&#8221; she observed
quietly and coldly. &#8220;This will not be child&#8217;s
play.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa was wearing a hooded cloak over her
dress. Mechanically she unfastened and laid it
aside. Shrinking from the absurd wrong and
wickedness of the act they were about to commit,
yet recognizing that she must make this desperate
stroke as her only chance of escape, she felt no trace
of fear, and her hope was that she might succeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
in quickly disarming her adversary and so bring
the mad affair to an end almost as soon as it should
begin. Still she lingered, as one naturally delays
over the preparation for a distasteful act.</p>

<p>Royda had stood ready for many seconds before
Philippa took her sword and faced her for that most
extraordinary encounter. It was a strange sight.
The great rock-hewn room, the array of still, mail-clad
figures, standing like ghostly spectators of a
more singular combat than the wearers of the armour
in life had ever witnessed, the line stretching away
into the obscurity of the farther end of the room,
while the half light was reflected by the burnished
plates of the nearest figures on to the two women,
warm and panting with life and excitement, confronting
each other in what might be deadly combat.
Great was the contrast between them. Royda
d&#8217;Ivady was dark complexioned, not much above
the middle height, but exquisitely formed, the full
contour of her arms and bust and the rich-blooded,
olive-hued skin being shown to perfection now she
had removed her bodice; her face set with determination
and her pose full of watchful energy.
Philippa, a good head taller, long-limbed, her skin
dazzlingly white against the sombre surroundings,
with magnificent arms and shoulders&mdash;one showing
a great livid wale where the rapier had whipped
her&mdash;her figure perfect in its natural lines and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
mouldings, crowned by her royally set head and
wealth of light brown hair glinting as the light fell
on it. So she stood, a superb specimen of womanhood,
with an expression of quiet courage on her
face, handling her rapier with natural grace: it
was as though a lion were opposed to a leopard;
both were in earnest, yet perhaps hardly conscious
that the result of this unwitnessed duel might mean
murder.</p>

<p>In a moment their light rapiers had touched,
and at the contact all Royda&#8217;s fury, which had
lately been restrained, seemed to rush forth at
her very sword&#8217;s point. It was clear at the first
assault that both girls had some general idea of
thrust and parry, although neither might have any
practical skill in fence. After the first few passes
both fenced warily as though the very touch of the
steel had brought home to them the seriousness of
their encounter.</p>

<p>Royda pressed Philippa, whose part was purely
defensive, and who parried the vicious lunges as
well as she could, thanking her stars for the few
casual lessons which had taught her something
of the art. Availing herself of her superior height,
she tried several times to beat down the other&#8217;s
guard and disarm her, but failed through Royda&#8217;s
alertness and her own want of precise knowledge
as to how the stroke should be accomplished. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
natural coolness, however, stood her in a good
stead; Royda was hot-headed, quivering with
passion, and lunged so wildly that Philippa found
no difficulty, by keeping her head, in putting aside
the assailing point. So she continued on the defensive,
hoping that Royda would soon tire; indeed,
she felt confident of wearing her down if only she
could keep untouched, for she was strong, and to her
the slender sword was little heavier to wield than
a riding whip. So they fought on; Royda, pressing
forward, vindictive, panting with exertion and excitement;
Philippa calm, watchful, keeping her
adversary at bay by sheer cool-headedness and
strength of wrist, retreating at each more furious
thrust, but never taking advantage of an opening
for attack when she saw one. Not a word was
spoken: they moved silently over the smooth floor;
the only sound that broke the silence of that great
vault-like room being the subdued clash of the little
rapiers and the panting of the combatants. It was
unscientific sword-play, but the adversaries were
well matched, and the contest none the less exciting
and in deadly earnest. Royda&#8217;s point had drawn
blood more than once. There was a deep graze on
Philippa&#8217;s left shoulder, where she had let a lunge
pass too near, and her sword arm was bleeding
slightly. But neither of these trivial wounds was
deep enough to be felt through the excitement of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
duel and Philippa continued to take the onslaught
as coolly as when the fight began.</p>

<p>She had been gradually obliged to give ground
till she at length found herself driven to the wall,
where there was nothing for it but to attack or
turn, the latter a perilous man&#339;uvre, since she would
have to fight her way round at close quarters.
Royda, perceiving her intention, made several quick
passes, trying to frustrate it by pinning her in a
corner. She was, however, beginning to tire, and
so Philippa, putting forth all her strength, was able
to beat down her point, and by a quick movement
slip round. But as she did so her foot caught in
the beading of the raised platform on which the
armoured effigies stood: she recovered herself,
but in the act of letting go her long skirt it impeded
her spring and she stumbled. Royda, quick as
lightning, seized the opportunity, and lunging
swiftly pierced the side of her neck. Stung by the
pain Philippa sprang backwards, thereby disengaging
herself from the rapier&#8217;s point. Royda,
seeing the blood trickling over her enemy&#8217;s bosom,
and probably thinking the wound she had inflicted
worse than it really was, stood for a moment half
paralyzed with her guard lowered. Philippa, excited
and confused by the wound, struck down
Royda&#8217;s sword sharply and lunged. Royda could
not recover in time to parry the thrust, and the point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
passed through the fleshy part of her sword arm.
She gave a cry, dropped her rapier, and staggered
back. Philippa, springing forward, caught her
in her arms as she fell, and the sword, pulled by its
own weight from the wound, dropped ringing to
the floor.</p>

<small>THE FIGURE IN THE VALLEY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, I am so sorry! What fools we have been!&#8221;
Philippa cried, as she half carried Royda to a settee
and tried to staunch the wound.</p>

<p>Royda said nothing, either through faintness
or because she seemed overwhelmed with mortification
and disappointment. She turned her face
away and remained passive, as though utterly
beaten and discomfited, with teeth set hard and
the hand of the unwounded arm clenched.</p>

<p>&#8220;What madness it has been,&#8221; Philippa continued,
not heeding her adversary&#8217;s sullen attitude. &#8220;Why
would you not listen to my explanation? We are
utterly ruined now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are hurt too?&#8221; the wounded girl asked,
in a tone more of satisfaction than concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not much,&#8221; Philippa answered, with a
glance at the blood on her arms and breast. &#8220;But
you, Fr&auml;ulein, must have a doctor. What shall I
do? How can we explain this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be all right,&#8221; replied Royda, raising
herself with an effort and making a gesture of pushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
Philippa from her. &#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, get
away from this and leave me. Fate is on your side;
I cannot fight against it, and the sooner I am dead
the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fr&auml;ulein d&#8217;Ivady, if you knew&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Philippa
began in her distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know enough, too much, of you, Philippa
Harlberg. You bring me evil. I never knew
what failure was till you crossed my path. Go,
in Heaven&#8217;s name; I cannot bear the sight of you.
There is a door behind that trophy. It leads to a
passage through the rock and so out upon the side
of the valley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot go and leave you like this,&#8221; Philippa
protested. &#8220;Hateful as I may be to you, I shall
not desert you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I must go,&#8221; Royda said, rising by sheer
power of will. &#8220;You stay at your own peril. I
have shown you the way of escape, if that is what
you seek. At least you shall not see Aubray Zarka.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the last thing I wish,&#8221; Philippa returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then go. If you try to follow me you will
regret it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing her determination Philippa took up the
articles of attire she had laid aside, and proceeded
not without pain, to put them on. She offered to
assist Royda with her garments, but was coldly
repulsed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>&#8220;You are wise to go,&#8221; Royda said significantly,
as she pressed a handkerchief to her wounded arm.
&#8220;There is the door. You cannot miss the way,
and the outer door at the end of the passage opens
by pulling the handle. The secret lock is from the
outside. Now turn that knob; I cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa did as directed, and the heavy door with
its trophy of arms swung slowly open. She lingered.
&#8220;Fr&auml;ulein,&#8221; she said earnestly, as she pointed
to the other&#8217;s wound, &#8220;that is the only harm I have
ever knowingly done you. Will you not forgive me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her tone was so gentle, so pleading, that Royda
looked at her sharply and as though suspicious of
hypocrisy. &#8220;Forgive you!&#8221; site repeated bitterly,
drearily. &#8220;How can you ask me that? No,&#8221;
she went on, with a swift change of tone as her
resentment welled up again: &#8220;I cannot forgive
you; no, never! You have ruined my life; innocently
or not is nothing to me. But you shall not
suffer for this night&#8217;s work if I can help it. Now,
go!&#8221;</p>

<p>A peremptory gesture cut short Philippa&#8217;s hesitation.
She took up a candle by Royda&#8217;s direction,
and without another word went out through the
doorway which was then closed upon her. For a
moment a horrible fear of a trap came upon her.
What if she were buried alive in the depth of the
rock? But she took courage, as by the light she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
made out the passage stretching before her, and she
began to make her way along it as fast as she could,
always descending, sometimes by a gentle slope
sometimes by a few shallow steps. Expecting
every moment to arrive at the outlet, the passage
began to seem interminable; but at last she reached
the end and the small iron-clamped door. In a
moment she had unlatched it and passed through.
She found herself in a shrubbery, so thick as to be
almost impassable, but by dint of feeling her way
she pushed along a concealed path which gradually
grew less dense, and after a while led her into comparatively
open woodland.</p>

<p>The storm had passed away, the stars were
shining between the masses of light drifting cloud,
and the air had never seemed to Philippa so fresh
as now after the tension of the scene in the great
rock-chamber, and the close atmosphere of the long
passage. Making her way down the side of the
valley she soon reached the path running along it,
which would lead her home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In that night of adventure Von Tressen little
dream how near he and Philippa were to one
another. The Lieutenant and Galabin had resolved
to pay Rozsnyo another visit and, if they
should find it possible, make a bolder attempt to
solve the mystery of the masked prisoner. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
they arrived outside the walk they saw that the
window was closed and hidden. Passing on, they
reached their climbing place and were quickly on
the roof. As they cautiously went forward they
were somewhat exercised to notice that the ascending
stream of light was not to be seen, and on coming
to the barred skylight they found that the room
below was in darkness. This in a moment frustrated
their plans, for obviously it would be unsafe,
if not absolutely useless, to try to attract the
prisoner&#8217;s attention when they could not see him
or know whether he was alone. So after waiting
some time in the hope that a light might appear,
they were reluctantly forced to the conclusion that
there was nothing for it but to abandon the attempt
for that night. They were accordingly making their
way back when an unexpected thing happened.
As Von Tressen quietly slid down the wall he suddenly
found himself in contact with a moving
body, and next instant was seized by the throat.
A desperate struggle thereupon ensued between
him and his unknown assailant; it was pitch dark,
and the Lieutenant could make out nothing of the
man&#8217;s face; all he knew was that he must put forth
all his strength to hold his own. In the struggle
they worked their way to the edge of the slope
and then went crashing down together. By this
time Galabin had descended, and, taking in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
situation, rushed to his friend&#8217;s assistance. Between
them they quickly overpowered the unknown
assailant, who continued to struggle desperately,
and were able to hold him down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep a look-out for another attack,&#8221; Von Tressen
said to Galabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Von Tressen?&#8221; gasped the man
they were holding down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr D&#8217;Alquen?&#8221; they both cried in surprise.</p>

<p>It was none other than their mysterious acquaintance.
For some seconds he lay back panting, then
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;May one ask what you two were doing on that
wall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may guess?&#8221; Galabin answered. &#8220;I
fancy we have as much right here as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their prisoner laughed. &#8220;That can hardly be
settled without explanation. At least you may
tell me one thing. Are you here as friends of Count
Zarka?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly, perhaps,&#8221; Galabin replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen said. &#8220;It is singular that
we should be both here like thieves from a different
motive.&#8221;</p>

<p>An idea had occurred to Galabin, a probable
explanation of D&#8217;Alquen&#8217;s movements. &#8220;Perhaps
our motives may not have been so different,&#8221; he
said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>&#8220;I cannot talk on my back with two men throttling
me,&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen growled. &#8220;Let me sit up,
will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>A little suspiciously they relaxed their hold
so that he could assume a more comfortable posture
for conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has your business,&#8221; he asked, in his characteristically
fierce, eager manner, &#8220;anything to
do with a mysterious window in the wall yonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin reflected a moment and then answered;
&#8220;Yes; it has.&#8221;</p>

<p>D&#8217;Alquen&#8217;s eyes seemed to glitter through the
darkness. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; he cried eagerly. &#8220;You know,
then? There is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He stopped abruptly.
&#8220;But you are friends of the Count?&#8221; he said distrustfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we are not,&#8221; Galabin replied. &#8220;You can
speak quite freely to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a few moments there was silence as the two
waited for D&#8217;Alquen to continue. At last he said:
&#8220;You have heard, of course, of Prince Roel&#8217;s
death?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of his disappearance, certainly, and his rumoured
death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes! You believe it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the Prince is dead? Hardly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen demanded quickly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>&#8220;We may have reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Reasons, yes; to think that he is here&mdash;here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may be here&mdash;or anywhere else,&#8221; Galabin
replied guardedly. &#8220;If he is not dead&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen seemed to read the other&#8217;s
thoughts although he could not see his face. &#8220;You
know more than you will tell. I have suspected
it, but it seemed impossible for two sportsmen&mdash;&mdash;.
Now you may tell me what you know. I am Prince
Roel&#8217;s cousin, and have sworn to clear up the
mystery of his disappearance, and if necessary to
avenge him. I regret that I was compelled to take
the Herr Lieutenant by the throat; I mistook him
for a spy of that fellow Zarka&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we were inclined to set you down as the
same,&#8221; Von Tressen laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not let us stay here talking,&#8221; Galabin suggested.
&#8220;We may be overheard, with unpleasant
results. We had better be moving back towards
our tent, unless you have a plan to carry through
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least let us first compare notes,&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen
replied. &#8220;If we act together the solution of the
terrible mystery may be easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rising from the ground, the three men stole
across to the wood, whence they shaped their course
to the valley.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>&#8220;My idea is,&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen said presently, &#8220;that
this fellow Zarka is responsible for my kinsman&#8217;s
disappearance, for it is suspected at home that he
is in league with the Russians. Whether poor Roel
is alive or dead by now I cannot tell; if alive,
it is because that villain dare not kill him, at least
till he has made sure of the consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>They told him of the masked man. He stopped
and flung up his arms excitedly. &#8220;Roel! Roel!&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;Thank Heaven, at last I can make an
effort for your liberty, or at least give my life for
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any necessity for that?&#8221; Von Tressen
observed. &#8220;If we are sure the Prince is there a
prisoner, why not inform the Chancellor and let the
authorities proceed against Zarka?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; it would be too late,&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; our friend is right,&#8221; Galabin said. &#8220;We
should run the risk of defeating our own ends.
For before the Government could come to the
rescue, the Prince would be dead and buried a
hundred feet down in the rock. No; we must
not force Zarka&#8217;s hand, especially as he has his
friends over the mountains to look to. And, after
all, we have no certain proof as yet that the man
in the mask is Prince Roel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; no proof,&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen said feverishly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
&#8220;yet we may be certain of it. All the actors in
the wretched affair are here in the forest: Count
Zarka, the gaoler and prospective assassin, my kinsman,
the poor victim, and the lady of the farm,
the decoy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin glanced anxiously at Von Tressen, who
started as though he had been struck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Decoy?&#8221; he demanded hoarsely. &#8220;What do
you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>D&#8217;Alquen turned to him with a fierce excited vent
of repressed knowledge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean nothing less than I say. This woman&mdash;lady,
if you will&mdash;who is staying so unaccountably,
so mysteriously at the old farm, is nothing less,
or nothing more, than a creature of Zarka&#8217;s, whom
he has employed to delude my poor cousin and betray
him to his death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible; it is a lie!&#8221; the Lieutenant
cried hotly.</p>

<p>Galabin made a restraining gesture. &#8220;Let us
hear what proof Herr D&#8217;Alquen has of his assertion,&#8221;
he said quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Proof!&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen returned. &#8220;Is any proof
necessary to one who is not blind? Why are these
people living at the farm? Why is Zarka there so
constantly and on such a confidential footing,
if there is no understanding between them? Is
it not known that a woman was the instrument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
of Roel&#8217;s spiriting away? She has disappeared
too, for a good reason, and I say she is here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke in a tone of fierce conviction, and
Von Tressen, surprised and recalling the scene he
had witnessed that morning, for the moment could
not reply. Galabin spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are hardly in a position to disprove or even
contradict what you assert&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do,&#8221; Von Tressen broke in warmly.
&#8220;You have no proof, mein Herr, only surmise and
suspicion. It is unchivalrous, unmanly, to take
away a lady&#8217;s reputation on such grounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a fine champion, mein Lieutenant,&#8221;
D&#8217;Alquen returned with a sneer. &#8220;But I maintain
that to any one not blinded by partiality the evidence
I have is conclusive. Let me&mdash;ah! Look,&#8221;
he cried suddenly breaking off and pointing excitedly
towards the valley which lay before them.
&#8220;Yonder!&mdash;yonder! Who is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other two looked eagerly towards the spot
he indicated. For a few seconds the drifting clouds
let a stream of moonlight fall aslant the valley.
And across this band of light a figure was moving
quickly&mdash;a woman. Then a thick bank of cloud
swept over the moon and all was darkness, as Von
Tressen sprang forward with a cry almost of despair.
D&#8217;Alquen laughed.</p>

<small>THE NECK-BAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> took a great deal, in a general way, to astonish
Aubray Zarka, nevertheless the frame of mind
in which that enterprising nobleman rode to Gorla&#8217;s
farm next day was one bordering on sheer amazement.
And the cause of his wonder was the mysterious
wound which had thrown his cousin Royda
d&#8217;Ivady into a fever. The doctor who had been
summoned was a discreet man, even for a physician,
and he had promised his very interesting patient
to abstain from all allusion to that puncture in the
right shoulder; but face to face with Zarka, ever
suspiciously on the alert, his resolution was swept
away like thistle-down. Poor man! The countenance
of the lord of Rozsnyo was more to him than
the secret of a hysterical girl; so the existence of the
rapier wound was disclosed. But Doctor Horvath
could not tell his patron one thing, for he did not
know it himself, although he found some difficulty
in persuading the Count of that&mdash;how the wound
had come to be inflicted. Neither could he find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
this out from his patient, although, at a hint from
Zarka, he tried to do so.</p>

<p>But Zarka found it out&mdash;at least enough to enable
him to make a shrewd guess at the rest. How&mdash;probably
no one but himself exactly knew&mdash;but
the fact that Royda&#8217;s fever made her occasionally
light-headed may furnish a clue to the means.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be sorry to hear that my cousin Royda
d&#8217;Ivady is seriously ill,&#8221; he remarked to Philippa
when they met. She stole an apprehensive glance
at him, but his face was even more smilingly inscrutable
than usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to hear it,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I hope
it is nothing dangerous?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; a severe accident on which fever has
supervened. Her condition is grave, but she is in
good hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An accident?&#8221; Philippa was forced to show
some curiosity, but it needed all her self-command
to keep the right tone and avoid a suspicion of
guilty knowledge; above all, to repress the sickening
fear and self-reproach which had come over
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Zarka answered, fixing his piercing
eyes on her face, &#8220;perhaps we ought not to call
it an accident. It is altogether a mysterious
business, but I feel sure accident is the wrong word
to use. My cousin has received a severe wound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
in the shoulder; she has been stabbed&mdash;the arm
run through with a sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then where is the mystery, Count?&#8221; Philippa
asked, boldly meeting the feline gaze. &#8220;Surely
Fr&auml;ulein d&#8217;Ivady can tell you how she came by the
wound?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not asked her,&#8221; he replied significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You prefer to remain mystified?&#8221; she suggested,
with a half smile.</p>

<p>For a moment he looked like a tiger on the
spring, as though her manner and his guess at the
cause of Royda&#8217;s wound were provocative beyond
endurance, but he checked the impulse, merely
replying: &#8220;It is, perhaps, not so much a mystery
after all.&#8221; Then he added suddenly, shooting out the
question like a dart: &#8220;You have a cold, Fr&auml;ulein?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment she did not see what he was aiming
at. &#8220;A cold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your throat is wrapped up,&#8221; he explained,
pointing to the unusually high band of lace round
her neck.</p>

<p>She did not recover from her disadvantage in
time to prevent a slight flush. &#8220;My throat pained
me a little this morning,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Not from cold, perhaps?&#8221; There was the
gleam of an underlying meaning in his sharp eyes.
&#8220;Our valley is damp at night. You are wise to keep
your throat wrapped up.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>&#8220;It is nothing,&#8221; she replied, facing the fire of his
scrutiny as steadily as she could.</p>

<p>He gave a little bow, as ending the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came over, Fr&auml;ulein,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to ask you a
question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that, Count?&#8221;</p>

<p>If she thought it had to do with her night&#8217;s
adventure she was mistaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;A simple one,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Whether you
have yet seen proper to change your no into a
yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least,&#8221; he continued insistently, &#8220;we are
nearer to the happy word than we were yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Count, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he would not accept her denial. &#8220;Oh, yes,
we are,&#8221; he maintained. &#8220;I gave you a week,
Fr&auml;ulein, and much of that has yet to pass. It
will take less than a week for you to see the folly
of your refusal, the wisdom of throwing in your
lot with the only man who can rescue you from a
terrible danger, and make you one of the most
envied women in the land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa made no response. She was sick at
heart at the evidence of the man&#8217;s indomitable
will, and the conviction of his utter unscrupulousness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>Returning through the forest Zarka, as much,
perhaps, by design as accident, encountered Von
Tressen and Galabin. He gave the young men a
salutation which bore no trace of the ill-feeling in
which he had last parted from Von Tressen. His
expression was serious without, for him, especial
malevolence, and to the Lieutenant&#8217;s surprise he
reined up and spoke to them, addressing himself,
however, more particularly to Galabin. After a
few casual inquiries as to their sport, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am rather in trouble at Rozsnyo, and you will,
I am sure, be sorry when you hear the cause. My
cousin, Fr&auml;ulein d&#8217;Ivady, is seriously ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>They expressed their regret at the news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Zarka went on; &#8220;it is most unfortunate,
and the more provoking as the illness is the result
of an accident, the outcome of a foolish escapade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; Galabin responded, wondering how
far the man was to be believed.</p>

<p>Zarka proceeded. &#8220;A most unheard-of affair.
It is extraordinary to what lengths our country-women&#8217;s
hot blood will sometimes drive them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dare we ask for an account of what has happened?&#8221;
Galabin observed, curious to know what
the arch schemer was driving at.</p>

<p>Zarka hesitated with a grin and a shrug. &#8220;As
I am in the somewhat delicate position of being the
indirect, even if not the direct, cause of the affair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
I fear I must not speak very plainly. I don&#8217;t
pretend to be more modest than the average, but
there is a code among men of honour which forbids
boasting. But what do you think, gentlemen,
of a duel, a serious duel, with rapiers at night
between two ladies?&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin glanced apprehensively from the sinister
smiling face to that of his friend, and began to regret
his curiosity. Von Tressen&#8217;s look was set, and he
made no sign of joining in the talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Between ladies? Absurd!&#8221; Galabin laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absurd enough in one way,&#8221; Zarka returned,
&#8220;yet very serious in another. I wish Fr&auml;ulein
d&#8217;Ivady&#8217;s wound were as absurd as its cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Galabin&#8217;s intention to make an attempt
to dismiss the subject, but before he could do so
Von Tressen spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say, Count, that Fr&auml;ulein d&#8217;Ivady has
fought a duel with another lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka smiled. &#8220;So it appears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you really believe it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unhappily the evidence is too strong to do otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the name of her opponent a secret?&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin interposed. &#8220;My dear Osbert, what
does it matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Lieutenant made a gesture to silence
him. His face was stern, and the eyes which met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
the Count&#8217;s had an angry gleam. &#8220;It does matter,&#8221;
he insisted. &#8220;There are not so many ladies in the
neighbourhood capable of fighting a duel that the
withholding of the name should hurt no particular
reputation. Count Zarka has boasted that a duel
was fought on his account&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; Zarka protested, hardly disguising
his evil satisfaction at the way his rival was walking
into the trap.</p>

<p>&#8220;You suggested it, Count,&#8221; Von Tressen returned,
with a touch of contempt. &#8220;It seems to me you
have said either too much or too little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka gave a shrug. &#8220;Too much, if you will.
So I will add no more. You say there are few
ladies in the forest, then it should not be difficult
for the Herr Lieutenant to guess the name of my
cousin&#8217;s opponent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be affectation to ignore your insinuation,&#8221;
Von Tressen replied with spirit. &#8220;But
if it points to Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg, I can only tell you,
Count, I take the liberty of disbelieving your
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka gave an unpleasant laugh. &#8220;I know of no
one else who could have been my poor cousin&#8217;s
adversary. Nevertheless, not having been present
at the encounter, I am as much in the dark as yourself,
Herr Lieutenant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let me tell you, Herr Graf,&#8221; Von Tressen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
returned hotly, &#8220;that you have no right on mere
conjecture to cast aspersions on a lady&#8217;s reputation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fighting of a duel,&#8221; Zarka objected with
insolent coolness, &#8220;is, between women, ridiculous
enough, but hardly a matter of dishonour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; Von Tressen retorted, &#8220;when it is fought
for the reason your modesty allows you to suggest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka smiled indulgently. &#8220;You are a young
man, Herr Lieutenant, and your natural chivalry
makes you incredulous. But if you lived a thousand
years in the world you would still have much to
learn of women&#8217;s ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; Von Tressen returned; &#8220;but in this
instance I am concerned only with one woman.
And I say you have no right without proof to
associate Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg with this escapade.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka&#8217;s face began to darken. &#8220;The Fr&auml;ulein
has a zealous champion,&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;Perhaps,
if it were worth while, I might challenge our Lieutenant&#8217;s
right to that office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may,&#8221; Von Tressen cried; &#8220;and I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka waved his arm. &#8220;For the moment we
talk of proof,&#8221; he interrupted haughtily. &#8220;For
that I must refer you to the lady herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Galabin interposed. &#8220;This is waste of time.
Von Tressen, is it worth while&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka stopped him. &#8220;One moment, gentlemen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
My suggestion is not quite so useless as you imagine.
The Lieutenant has asked for proof. I will tell
him where to get it. If I am wrong then I will
accept the consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where am I to find this proof?&#8221; Von Tressen
demanded.</p>

<p>Zarka was very calm now. &#8220;Where I told you,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;From Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not insult her by suggesting such a thing,&#8221;
Von Tressen returned indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not,&#8221; Zarka rejoined with a smile.
&#8220;You have but to pay a visit to the farm and notice
whether the Fr&auml;ulein&#8217;s throat is bound up. I fancy
she did not come through the encounter quite unscathed.
That should be proof enough for a reasonable
man. If I am wrong in my assertion I shall
be happy to give you any satisfaction you may
demand. For the present there is no more to be
said. Good-day, gentlemen. <i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave a touch to the bridle, wheeled, and rode
off, the very incarnation of triumphant, Satanic
politeness.</p>

<p>For the few seconds which elapsed before Zarka
was out of sight neither of the two men spoke. Then
as Galabin glanced at his friend, the Lieutenant
turned away with a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe what that fellow says?&#8221;
Galabin observed sympathetically. &#8220;What is this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
but a new move in his game. He sees he cannot
coerce or frighten you, that you mean to stand up
to him, and so is attacking you from behind. I
thought there was some object in his rather unnatural
civility, considering, that is, the terms on
which you stand with him. No, no; you must not
believe it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But his friend was unconvinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe it?&#8221; he cried miserably. &#8220;I would
give my right hand not to believe it. But I fear
it may be all too true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear friend,&#8221; Galabin remonstrated;
&#8220;which is more likely to deceive you, this man Zarka,
whose ways we know are crooked, or the girl, whom
you have every reason to trust?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know; I cannot understand it,&#8221; Von
Tressen replied desperately. &#8220;It is all so mysterious;
our seeing her in the forest with the man
she professes to hate: it tallies with D&#8217;Alquen&#8217;s
account of her; then the woman we saw in the
valley last night, going towards the farm&mdash;ah,
I wish I could have caught her and known the
truth!&mdash;and now this story of the duel. Horaz,
I hate myself for the thought, but I must put this
terrible uncertainty beyond a doubt at once. I
am going to Gorla&#8217;s Farm to put it to the proof.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Philippa, ever now on the watch, saw him coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
down to the valley, and went eagerly to meet
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad you have come,&#8221; she said, with a
suspicion of reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have come before this,&#8221; he replied,
&#8220;only I thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You thought?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That perhaps you were too much engaged to
care to see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew from his tone what she had already
guessed from the manner of his greeting, that he
was jealous and suspicious. That unlucky meeting
in the forest had worked its effects.</p>

<p>&#8220;Osbert!&#8221; she returned reproachfully. &#8220;Indeed,
I have wanted to see you very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the first excitement of their meeting he had
had no thought of the proof which Zarka had
bidden him look for. Now the delight called up
by her words was checked as he noticed the high
band round her throat. A chilling wave of despair
seemed to flow over him, and he replied almost
coldly; &#8220;You wished to see me? I hardly guessed
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>If she ignored his coldness it was because she
knew it to be natural. &#8220;I wanted to warn you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To warn me?&#8221; he asked half suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;To put you on your guard against Count
Zarka.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>&#8220;Your great friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not my friend, Osbert.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you seem to be on remarkably confidential
terms with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;But for all that we
are not friends; far from it. One day I will explain
it all to you, but not now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not now?&#8221; he returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Osbert, can you not trust me?&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>Her tone and the look which accompanied the
words would have surely convinced him had not
the tell-tale bandage continued to accuse her.
He hated himself for the words his suspicion made
him speak, shrank from the dilemma he must force
upon her: yet the horrible uncertainty could not
go on. He must get at the truth, whatever the
cost might be.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look pale, Philippa,&#8221; he said, trying to
steady his voice. &#8220;Are you not well? Why is
your throat wrapped up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a little cold,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;The band round your neck is not becoming,&#8221;
he continued, hating himself for the falsehood. &#8220;Is
your throat very bad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; not very,&#8221; she replied steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you would take all that lace
off for a moment.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>&#8220;Take it off? Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I may see you without it. See the difference
it makes. Come, dear, let me unwind it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrank back. &#8220;No, no. Please do not
touch it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Philippa, only for a moment,&#8221; he persisted,
hiding the bitterness that rose in his heart. &#8220;Do
take it off. I do not like you in it. Let me see
you for a moment without it.&#8221;</p>

<p>His insistence must have betrayed his suspicion.
She met him boldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot take the band off,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
have had a slight accident. I have hurt my throat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said it was a cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must keep the cold from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The wound?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence between them for a while.
Then Von Tressen said abruptly: &#8220;Philippa, I
hate mysteries. Will you not clear up the one
which stands between us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is none,&#8221; she protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is,&#8221; he returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;None that need trouble you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it does,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;Will you let our
betrothal be known?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet, Osbert.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least let Count Zarka know it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>She laughed. &#8220;Who else is there here? Count
Zarka is all the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell him,&#8221; Von Tressen said.</p>

<p>A look of fear crossed her face. &#8220;No, please,
Osbert, not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet there is no mystery. How did you
hurt your throat, Philippa?&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt her happiness was slipping away from
her, yet somehow she could not grasp and stay it.</p>

<p>&#8220;By a piece of stupidity too absurd to mention,&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;You need not look suspicious,
sir; the Count had no hand in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was not the cause?&#8221; he asked searchingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Philippa,&#8221; he said suddenly, &#8220;for Heaven&#8217;s
sake tell me what this man is to you. It is not fair
to let me imagine things. You must&mdash;ah! What
is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>In his vehemence he had grasped her arm in the
very place where Royda&#8217;s rapier had pierced it,
and she had given a cry of pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; she replied, quickly recovering herself.
&#8220;You hurt me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely not?&#8221; Then in a fresh access of suspicion
he asked: &#8220;You have wounded your arm,
too?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>&#8220;No&mdash;yes, it is tender,&#8221; she answered in distress.</p>

<p>He looked at her sadly, despairingly, yet with the
gentleness of a noble-minded man who would spare
her pain in the parting which now seemed inevitable.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I stay longer I shall hurt you more, it seems,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We had better say good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For how long?&#8221; The question was forced
from her, almost piteously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Till I am worthy of your confidence as well as
your love,&#8221; he answered coldly. &#8220;Till I know
how far Count Zarka&#8217;s presumption is justified.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Osbert!&#8221; she cried. In another minute he
might have learned the truth, but Harlberg came
in and cut short the word that was on her lips. She
felt faint with her weakness, bewildered by the
cruelty of her fate.</p>

<p>Her step-father asked her to fetch a book from
her room. As she went the great strain she had
undergone and the pain of her wound brought on
a slight faintness. When she had recovered sufficiently
to return to the room, Von Tressen was not
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I pressed him to stay,&#8221; Harlberg said, &#8220;but
he would go, and asked me to say good-bye for
him.&#8221;</p>

in a whirl of love, jealousy, and the rage of thwarted
will. But, notwithstanding the hazardous double
game he was playing, his was not a nature to admit
the possibility of anything but ultimate success.
His restrained fury which showed itself only in the
lowering face, the set jaw and a certain savage
impatience of gesture, was the result of the vexatious
counterchecks and what he regarded as the temporary
baffling in the plan which he had a few days
before been confident of carrying through without
the shadow of a difficulty. But that he had been
thwarted from an unexpected quarter did not abate
one jot of his fierce, ever-growing determination
to gain his end. Still, whether it was policy or
passion which prompted him, he told himself as he
rode along that no time was to be lost, and that the
sooner he resolved on a bold stroke the better it
would be. Time is seldom a trusted ally to men
of the gambler&#8217;s temperament; they play to win<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
or lose on the moment; delay is no factor in their
calculations.</p>

<p>Zarka rode on through the wild forest region
at a rate in keeping with his impatience, until,
having gone perhaps some half dozen miles, he
slackened his pace and turned along a rough bridle-path
which would bring him by a circuitous way back
to Rozsnyo. He had pursued this path for about
a mile when he came to a clearing in the woodlands
and upon an unexpected scene. In the midst of the
open space stood a half-ruined building which,
from a certain peculiarity in its architecture, had
clearly been, at any rate at one time or another,
designed for a chapel or oratory. It was, in fact,
the remains of a place of worship, built centuries
before for the celebration of the superstitious rites
of a semi-barbarous people. Grouped round the
little building with an air of expectancy were several
men and women, decked out in all the elaborate
finery of their picturesque native costume. They
were members of a community of forest dwellers,
their homes lying in various hamlets scattered
sparsely over those regions of wood and mountain.
A curious fierce race of grown-up children, whose
customs and superstitions seemed too hardy to be
ever withered by the breath of civilization.</p>

<p>So intent was the group on what it was evidently
awaiting that Zarka&#8217;s sudden appearance on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
scene, which in an ordinary way would have caused
some little commotion, passed almost unnoticed.
The reason was immediately apparent. Almost
simultaneously with his arrival the head of a quaint
procession was seen emerging through the trees upon
the open ground. The costumes of the peasants
who composed the little train showed a strange
mixture of sombreness and gaiety. The faces of
most of them were sad, yet their manner and
gestures seemed buoyant, almost joyful. All wore
favours and nosegays, and the girls of the party
carried wreaths of such bright flowers as were in
season.</p>

<p>Zarka reined in his horse and stood by, watching
the affair with an expression of cynical curiosity.
He guessed by certain tokens what the rite was, a
not infrequent ceremony in those wild parts, a
strange, old Magyar custom, surviving from the
Dark Ages&mdash;the Marriage of the Dead.</p>

<p>As the procession, followed by the onlookers,
entered the chapel, Zarka, rousing himself from his
scornful train of thought, touched his horse, as
though with the intention of continuing his way,
then suddenly seeming to change his mind, he reined
up again, dismounted, and, leisurely making fast
his bridle, strolled into the doorway of the chapel.</p>

<p>A singular spectacle was before him. The members
of the procession had already taken their places<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
and were on their knees. In front of a draped and
decked-out altar, which accorded strangely with
the crumbling walls, the broken windows and the
general dilapidated state of the building, in two
rudely-fashioned open coffins, hung by loving
hands with flowers, lay a young man and a young
woman, dressed in their full native costume of the
gayest colours, with which the deadly ashen hue of
their faces and hands made a sad contrast. Death
had so refined their features that they seemed of a
superior class to the assembly of their relatives and
neighbours; moreover that same kindly, awful
touch gave their faces a beauty which life, more
churlish, had denied. They had both died on the
same day, and in the minds of their simple kinsfolk
it seemed fitting that in accordance with an immemorial
custom, the Great Divider should join
those whom life would probably have kept apart
in mutual indifference. The service, or, rather,
the ethnical rite, proceeded, conducted by an old,
grey-bearded man, whose strongly marked features
and determined yet venerable expression of fierce
authority easily accounted for the high position
he seemed to hold in the community. He wore a
dark blue robe ornamented by symbols and mystic
characters embroidered down the front of the gown
and round the edges of the hanging sleeves. Below
this, incongruously enough, he showed a pair of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
thick Hungarian buskins. He chanted with that
peculiar melancholy inflection which is characteristic
of the Magyar voice what seemed a rude hymn,
in which at certain points the assemblage joined.
Presently, amid a movement of suppressed excitement,
he advanced to the bodies, and, taking a
ring from the man&#8217;s rigid hand, placed it upon the
girl&#8217;s cold finger. Then resuming his former place,
he knelt and recited what was evidently a prayer,
the whole congregation following him with a fervour
which made it seem as though, even in their almost
shocking ignorance and superstition, the spirit
of the Divinity were not far away, nearer, indeed,
to them than that lounging yet alert figure, the
very incarnation of evil, standing with a cynical
sneer in the porch.</p>

<p>When the strange rite was ended the officiating
patriarch changed his tone to a more natural inflection
and addressed to the relatives a few words
of sympathy, paying a tribute to the simple virtues
of the pair he had just wedded in death. Then the
kinsfolk left their places and clustered round the
bodies which were to lie there till next day, when
they would be committed to the earth in one grave.</p>

<p>As Zarka, having satisfied his curiosity, was
about to turn away, a unctuous, snuffling voice at
his elbow said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shocking superstition, is it not, Herr Count?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>The speaker was a man in priest&#8217;s garb, who had
been standing unnoticed behind him during the
greater part of the ceremony. A man with a fat,
sensual face, whose expression of professional
gravity was clearly assumed, since his nature was
obviously more worldly than ascetic.</p>

<p>Zarka gave a significant shrug. &#8220;A pathetic
ceremony, father,&#8221; he observed, with a cynical
grin which completely neutralized his words. &#8220;A
<i>memento mori</i> does one good occasionally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It should be helpful,&#8221; the other assented with
professional unction, contradicted somewhat by a
twinkle in his eye which seemed to want but little
encouragement to become a wink.</p>

<p>Evidently Zarka knew his man, since he was at
no pains either to moralize on the function they had
just witnessed or to disguise his scoffing humour.
He untied his horse, and throwing the bridle over
his arm was affable enough to offer to walk with
the priest for a part of the way home, a proposal
which the other welcomed with alacrity. Whatever
his private opinion of his companion may have been,
the lord of Rozsnyo and Obergespan of the district
was distinctly a personage of importance, and
as such was to be cultivated whenever opportunity
served.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have my sincere pity,&#8221; Zarka said presently,
&#8220;in having your lot cast among these obstinately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
benighted hinds. Your work must be discouraging.&#8221;</p>

<p>No one knew better than Zarka that whatever
effect his work might have on the portly priest, discouragement
could not be included in it, since
the somewhat scattered duties of his office were
scamped in the most flagrant way.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, indeed, far from what I could wish,&#8221; the
priest replied, with evasive meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Zarka proceeded, speaking more seriously
now as he drew nearer to the object he had in view,
&#8220;I am sure of it. You are, if I may say so, my
dear Hornthal, too good for your surroundings.
You have,&#8221; he glanced at the ample figure of his
companion, &#8220;you have a cathedral presence, and
we find you in a barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest acknowledged the compliment with a
bow and a gratified smile. &#8220;A comfortable barn,&#8221;
he smirked, &#8220;thanks to your lordship, with the
chaplaincy of Rozsnyo.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka could be very pleasantly insinuating when
it suited him to assume that manner. He laid his
hand familiarly on the priest&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seriously, my good friend,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;are you not wasted in these wilds? Have I any
right to try and keep you when I know you to be
fitted for a larger sphere? Are we not both selfish,
you because you are comfortable, I because I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
loath to part with my only pleasant and cultivated
neighbour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you, Herr Graf, should be good enough to
obtain preferment for me,&#8221; Hornthal responded,
with a greedy smile and twinkle, &#8220;I should not
hesitate to mortify the present selfishness both of
the lord of Rozsnyo and the priest of Lilienthal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka laughed appreciatively. &#8220;Hardly an equal
penance, my good father,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but that shall
not deter me from serving a friend. Seriously,
I have greater influence in high quarters than you
perhaps suspect, and it is entirely at your service
in consideration of many a dull evening you have
brightened for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether or not Hornthal believed his patron
capable of assisting his advancement, there was
clearly no harm in allowing him to try. &#8220;You are
too good and gracious, Count, towards my poor
deserts,&#8221; he said with a courtier-like demeanour.
&#8220;Apropos of your most kind promises, I may
mention that I hear Canon Lakner of Kulhausen
has had a second stroke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would naturally step into his shoes if you
cared for them,&#8221; Zarka replied, his casual tone
suggesting that it was a matter of course. &#8220;They
are doubtless a serviceable pair, if a little homely.
But I was thinking of something smarter for you
than that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>Hornthal&#8217;s eyes glistened. &#8220;You are too good,
Count. May I be worthy of your gracious opinion.&#8221;
Then as, perhaps, doubting his own qualifications
for still higher preferment or his patron&#8217;s ability
to obtain it for him, he added: &#8220;All the same,
Kuhlhausen is a snug, pleasant benefice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah, man!&#8221; Zarka exclaimed, with an affectation
of impatience; &#8220;you have no ambition.
Abilities and social gifts like yours would be thrown
away in a wretched commercial little place like
Kulhausen. Pearls before swine, my dear Hornthal.
Were I in your position with an influential friend
at my elbow, I would never rest till I had exchanged
that&#8221;&mdash;he tapped significantly the priest&#8217;s
well-worn oak stick with his riding whip&mdash;&#8220;your
parish cudgel for a pastoral staff. Or my patronage
is worth nothing. Good men must be picked up
when they are found, and not left to rust. You
know the world; you have travelled and seen men
and cities. You are simply mislaid among these
superstitious boors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doubtless the sanguine tone he assumed was infectious,
for the priest exclaimed with an expression
of genuine delight: &#8220;Count, you take my breath
away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka had produced the effect he had aimed at,
and could dismiss the subject for the time with an
appreciatory nod. &#8220;Come and dine to-night,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
he said, as he prepared to mount his horse. &#8220;I
am quite alone, and we can discuss over a bottle
of Imperial Tokay how far my intention of serving
you fits in with your ambition. Only, do not let
the idea of preferment take away your appetite
as well as your breath,&#8221; he added, with a half sneer
which his smile did not disguise. &#8220;You Church
dignitaries, my good father, must show us you know
how to live, or how shall we believe you when you
take upon yourselves to teach us how to die? At
seven then, to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, with a laugh which had more meaning in it
than the priest comprehended, he rode on.</p>

<small>A DESPERATE STROKE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">They</span> tell me I am dying. I must see you. Come.
You need not fear. R. d&#8217;I.&#8221;</p>

<p>These words scrawled in a note had been brought
to Philippa. She had hesitated; then, in an access
of grief and consternation, determined to go to
Rozsnyo. She seemed to have no fear of Zarka now.
The great joy of her life was gone, and she could
defy this man at last, careless of consequences. So,
telling her step-father that she was going to Rozsnyo
to see the Count&#8217;s cousin, who was ill, she set out
along the valley. Harlberg made no objection;
the plan did not affect him, and he was, if anything,
rather pleased at any sign of greater friendliness
between Zarka and Philippa. Half an hour&#8217;s walk
brought her to Rozsnyo.</p>

<p>As she approached the castle a man suddenly
appeared in her path, and accosting her with a bow
addressed her by name, and begged her to allow
him to conduct her to Fr&auml;ulein d&#8217;Ivady. He was
dressed in plain livery and had the air of a confidential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
body-servant, and, although instinctively
mistrusting his keen, crafty face, Philippa could
not do otherwise than follow him. He deferentially
led the way across the bridge to the private door
where Philippa had been surprised, thence into the
castle and to the room which Royda used as a
boudoir.</p>

<p>In answer to Philippa&#8217;s inquiry he told her that
Fr&auml;ulein d&#8217;Ivady was, he thought, asleep; but
would the honoured Fr&auml;ulein wait, and he would
ascertain? If the gracious Fr&auml;ulein would take
some refreshment after her walk? He indicated
a tray on which were some dainty cakes and a flask
of Tokay. Without waiting for an answer he poured
out a glass of wine, and with a ceremonious bow
quitted the room.</p>

<p>Left alone, Philippa walked to the window and
looked out upon the great valley beneath, fenced
in by vine-clad hills, above which again, in darker
contrast, stretched away the magnificent pine forests,
then, still beyond, the snow-capped heights
of the Carpathians. It made her unutterably sad
to think that a life was ebbing away from a world
that was so beautiful: that the young girl lying
a few yards from that room might never look on
that glorious scene again, nor roam through that
fairyland. Done to death through a moment&#8217;s
madness, and by her. How bitterly she regretted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
the chance that had taken her to Rozsnyo that
night, and led to her attracting Royda&#8217;s attention.
Just as a ray of hope seemed to have pierced through
the mist of danger which had enveloped her, a
black cloud had shut it out again, and there seemed
now nothing for her but despair. She leaned her
face against the window in an agony of grief. Then
she suddenly became aware that some one had entered
the room. She turned; it was Zarka.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came,&#8221; Philippa said, &#8220;to inquire after
Fr&auml;ulein d&#8217;Ivady; if possible, to see her. How is
she?&#8221;</p>

<p>She asked the question apprehensively, noticing
that he looked very grave. He shook his head.
His eyes, however, were at variance with his demeanour;
the sight of Philippa always brought
a peculiar glitter into them. It was there now.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Royda is gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is not dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa turned away with the bitterness of
death at her heart. For many seconds there was
silence in the room. But the man&#8217;s eyes never
left her form, and the glitter was never quenched
for an instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I not have seen her?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>&#8220;It would have been useless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;for Heaven&#8217;s sake, let me go.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she turned the glitter fastened on her face,
which was convulsed with tearless grief. It had
seen scorn there and anger, but usually the calmness
of self-control and indifference. Never a softer
emotion. And as the glitter marked this it seemed
to coruscate.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will make amends,&#8221; Zarka said, taking a
step to intercept her.</p>

<p>She stopped short, as though to avoid coming in
contact with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I mean, Philippa. You know
what you can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she exclaimed in shocked repugnance.
&#8220;How can you speak of that now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, of all times,&#8221; he returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; Philippa replied, almost with
a touch of her old disdain, &#8220;that I would so insult
her dead memory? Count, have you no sense of
decency?&#8221;</p>

<p>A dazed feeling came over her. It was only by
an effort that she kept her mind clear. Although
she spoke boldly she felt trapped and powerless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it nothing to me to lose Royda?&#8221; Zarka
exclaimed passionately. &#8220;Girl, can you not recognize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
your own work? That if I forget grief and
decency it is for love of you? That I am not
master of myself, have no feeling but my mad love
for you? Philippa, will you kill me as you have
killed her? I cannot live without you! If I am
to be alive at sunrise to-morrow it must be as your
husband!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count, this is madness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have made me mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you take the consequences?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. If I must.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, then! But you shall see her first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laid his hand on her arm, but she shook it
off and drew back. He opened the door; she went
out in a confused, uncaring state of mind, he following.
The anterooms and passages of the castle
were lighted dimly, not much more than enough
to enable them to see their way. No one was about,
and the place was absolutely still. In the long
corridor Zarka quickened his pace till he came a
little in advance of his companion, showing her
the way. As he stopped and laid his hand on a
door, Philippa said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you taking me? I wish to go back
to the farm at once.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>&#8220;You will see Royda first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. What good would that do? Am I not
punished enough for my folly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, then. I will obey you. We will go
another way. The room where she lies is far from
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw the door wide open. Within was a
stiffly furnished anteroom lined with bookcases,
and containing simply a large round table with
a jade top, and a dozen high-backed chairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the shortest way,&#8221; he said, crossing the
room and opening at the farther end a door masked
by book-backs. &#8220;Here we are in the picture
gallery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa passed through the second door somewhat
reassured. The same subdued light was over
the great gallery, which seemed dreary and ghostly
in its vast dimensions and semi-darkness. Zarka
walked on towards the dimly-seen farthermost
end, Philippa following as in a dream.</p>

<p>He unlocked a door, and they passed out of
the gallery first into a smaller one fitted with sculpture
and bas-reliefs, then across a marble pillared
vestibule and through one of its many doors, not
into the open air as Philippa expected, but into an
apartment hung with pictures of sacred subjects.
The decoration of this room was decidedly ecclesiastical;
a Pieta occupied a prominent place, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
a great Scripture tapestry, projected on a rod,
evidently covered another door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Philippa, you must marry me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words, breaking the silence between them
which had lasted for some time, startled Philippa
out of her apathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Count! No, never!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then shrinking back and noticing her surroundings,
it flashed upon her whither he had brought
her.</p>

<p>Zarka went to the tapestry and glanced behind
it as though to see that they were alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to seem harsh,&#8221; he said, in the resolute
tone of a man who has made up his mind
to a plan and is going to put it into execution.
&#8220;But if you knew the strength of my love for you,
you would understand that I am bound to have
my desire&mdash;if not by persuasion, then by force.
I am no longer master of myself in the matter.
Many a happy marriage has come of a rough wooing.
Be sensible, dear, and accept the inevitable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; Philippa cried. &#8220;Zarka, you coward!
You shall never marry me against my will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not; but I am bound, much against
my will, to bring some pressure to bear. It is for
your good. I do you no harm; where is the
dishonour in my proposal? That you shall be
my wife, my queen?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>&#8220;I tell you, no! I will never marry you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall never marry any other man. Consider
the position in which you stand. You leave
Rozsnyo in custody as Royda d&#8217;Ivady&#8217;s murderess,
or you stay here as my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let me go! I am innocent, Heaven knows,
but I would rather die than marry you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka seemed to grind his teeth for very exasperation.
&#8220;The girl is bewitched,&#8221; he said, more to
himself than to her. &#8220;No woman ever spurned
me like this. I cannot see you dragged away to
jail,&#8221; he went on in a louder tone, &#8220;and I will
not give you up. We must be married here and
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether it was from weakness or the apathy
of despair, or some subtle essence in the atmosphere
of the place, Philippa had felt dazed, and, with a
strange inertness, incapable of exerting her will
but as the full villainy of the trap flashed upon her,
indignation acting upon her nerves cleared her
brain, and gave her temporary strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dastardly ruffian!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;There
was a lower depth, then. I might have known it.
You think by force to make me your wife! I would
rather go to prison a thousand times over, die a
thousand deaths before I would give myself to a
man I so loathe&mdash;ah, I cannot tell you how I loathe
you! Now, you have your answer, do your worst.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>&#8220;I will kill you, Philippa,&#8221; he returned with
savage intensity, &#8220;if I cannot marry you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! you liar!&#8221; she cried, a new light breaking
upon her. &#8220;Royda is not dead, and you know it;
it was a vile trick. You dared not show her to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the worse for you, dear. Say you
are right and she is not dead, but alive a hundred
leagues away, then why are you here? You are
hopelessly compromised. Another alternative presents
itself, and a worse one. To-morrow morning
you are a disgraced woman&mdash;or Countess Zarka.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa could make no reply; her heart was
over-full of indignation and bitterness. The man
was too strong for her, and in his pitiless strength
was driving her surely to her doom. She felt
more and more her own weakness pitted against
him, the futility of her struggles. All hope seemed
to have vanished, and even could she beat this man,
victory would only mean prolonged misery, since
the zest of life was gone.</p>

<p>So she thought of her one feasible escape&mdash;death,
and calmly balanced it against union with Zarka.
This marriage would confirm Von Tressen&#8217;s opinion
of her; death would give it the lie. So she began
to contrive calmly how she could accomplish her
end.</p>

<p>&#8220;The General would be delighted at the news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
of our secret marriage,&#8221; Zarka said, breaking the
silence which he misinterpreted. &#8220;He would only
be too glad to hear it was all over, and welcome
you to-morrow as queen of Rozsnyo. Philippa,
you must take the step now. You cannot go back.
Honour is in front, shame and absolute disgrace
behind. If I have taken a mean advantage, think
of the odds I have had to fight against. Come!
Be sensible. If you leave here now you can never
hold your head up again; stay, and hold it higher
than any woman of your acquaintance&mdash;as the
bearer of my title. Is it so very dreadful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The name of one of the greatest villains in
Europe,&#8221; she said, in a low but perfectly distinct
voice.</p>

<p>Zarka made an exclamation of impatience, but
with wonderful self-control he gave no further
sign of anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have talked long enough,&#8221; he said, crossing
the room. &#8220;We shall never understand one another
till we are man and wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he pushed away the tapestry which
ran noiselessly on its rod, disclosing a pair of Gothic
doors of polished oak. At a push these swung
silently back revealing the private chapel of the
castle, lighted up as for service. Behind the altar
rails stood a man in robes, and with book in hand.</p>

<p>The sudden flood of light and the startling sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
of these preparations dazzled Philippa, who felt
sick and dazed, lying back half exhausted in the
great carved chair where she had fallen in her
misery.</p>

<p>Zarka made a step towards her and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; he said gently.</p>

<p>But she shrank away from him with an exclamation
of repugnance. He lifted his finger
to the priest, who left his place and came towards
them. The two men exchanged significant glances,
then the priest approached the miserable girl and
laid his hand lightly on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, my dear,&#8221; he said blandly. &#8220;Everything
is in order.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she clung to the arm of the great chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you, a minister of God, going to abet this
man in committing an awful villainy?&#8221; she cried,
looking up at the unctuous, placid face, in strong
contrast to her own features, working with the
tumult of her feelings.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mistaken,&#8221; he replied soothingly.
&#8220;I am here to ally you in the sacred bond of wedlock
with Count Zarka. Surely that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will be a monstrous crime,&#8221; she broke in.
&#8220;It is you who are mistaken, deceived by this
vilely dishonourable man, who has lured me here
and now proposes to marry me against my will.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>&#8220;I cannot believe it,&#8221; the priest responded,
while Zarka stood impassive a little way off with
folded arms. &#8220;How can so illustrious an alliance
be a crime? You are labouring under some delusion&mdash;perhaps
imagining that, by this private
ceremony, he means to act dishonourably. Let
me give you my sacred word as a priest that this
is not so. You will be his acknowledged wife,
a title to which no other woman has the slightest
pretension.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know, I know,&#8221; moaned Philippa, hopelessly
struggling. &#8220;But when I tell you that from
the very depths of my soul I hate this man, to
whom you think to wed me, that I would rather
you stabbed me to the heart this instant than
gave me his hated name, and him the right to&mdash;&mdash;.
Oh, sir, by the God you serve, save me from him,
from misery worse than death, and refuse to utter
one word of that office which must be now most
awful blasphemy!&#8221;</p>

<p>She had sunk on her knees to him, and was clutching
his gown in her agony. But her appeal had
no effect on him&mdash;at least none that was apparent.
Probably he judged her as a man of the world,
and easily silenced his scruples by the reflection that,
although she in her inexperience might not think
so, he was doing her a rare good turn. Whatever
his private opinion of his patron may have been,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
he could hardly conceive a girl could be in her right
senses to refuse his alliance. As well might he
refuse the preferment which Zarka had taken care
to dangle before his eyes. And then he had his
own ideas of women.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear young lady,&#8221; he said, taking her arm
to lift her, &#8220;you will thank me one day for this
night&#8217;s work. Come! In a few minutes you will
hold one of the most enviable positions in Europe,
in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she did not rise Zarka came quickly forward
and took her other arm. Between them they raised
her, and half led, half dragged her into the chapel,
and along the broad space up to the altar rails.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me die!&#8221; she moaned, struggling against
a great faintness. Then, though she felt that both
her arms were held, the priest appeared in front of
her before the altar he was desecrating. Turning
her head she saw by her side the cunning-faced
servant who had ushered her into the castle. He
was to be the witness of this diabolical sacrilege.</p>

<p>As the priest began to read the marriage office
the words, sounding in Philippa&#8217;s ears, gave warning
of the imminence of her hateful doom. In
a few seconds she would be irrevocably tied to
Zarka. Crying out in her desperation, she made
one last convulsive struggle to escape&mdash;to death,
if she could only lay her hands on the means. By<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
a supreme effort she freed herself from her captors
and made a wild rush towards the sacristy, hoping
in her despair to find a weapon to turn against them
or herself. But the servant, lithe and alert, was
after her like a greyhound. Closely followed by his
master, he caught her as she reached the door;
they stopped her, and began to force her back to
the altar. She struggled desperately and screamed,
but it was of no avail; Zarka was a man of immense
strength, and having gone so far, he was bound to
carry his project through by undisguised force since
persuasion was futile. Philippa was helpless in
his arms, and as they reached the altar rails again
she hung still in his hold, but leaning away from
him, utterly exhausted.</p>

<p>The priest, with no more concern on his face
than if he were marrying a couple of peasants at
Easter, lifted his book at a nod from Zarka and
resumed the recital of the office. Philippa heard
him pronounce Zarka&#8217;s name, and then her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she almost shrieked, desperately
protesting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Philippa!&#8221;</p>

<p>If she did not hear her name shouted the three
men did. The priest suddenly stopped in his
unctuous monotone, and his expression was not
so bland as usual as he glanced inquiringly at the
bridegroom. Before Zarka had recovered his surprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
sufficiently to take action the cry was repeated,
this time close at hand. &#8220;Philippa!&#8221; and in
another instant as the servant sprang to the sacristy
door, it was flung open and, thrusting the man
aside, Von Tressen rushed into the chapel followed
by Galabin.</p>

<small>THE END OF THE AFFAIR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a moment the two men had taken in the scene,
and Von Tressen strode quickly towards Zarka.
&#8220;You ruffian!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What is the meaning
of this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand away!&#8221; was the Count&#8217;s defiant reply.
&#8220;This lady is my wife, and you interfere at your
peril.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a lie!&#8221; Philippa gasped, recovering from
her half faint, and struggling to free herself from
Zarka&#8217;s grasp. &#8220;This man is a villain. I have
been lured to this place by a trick. Osbert, I hate
and loathe the man. I am not his wife; I would
rather die than marry him. Will you not&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before she could say more, Von Tressen&#8217;s arm
was round her, and his disengaged hand dealt the
Count a blow such as he had never felt before,
a square, well-placed hit, worthy of an Englishman,
which broke his hold of Philippa and sent him
staggering back, falling over the chairs ranged behind
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>He recovered himself quickly and, facing them,
white with rage and pain, seemed to be meditating
a rush. But he thought better of it, seeing that
the odds were against him. Von Tressen and
Galabin supported Philippa to a seat, where she
sank down overcome by fear and excitement.</p>

<p>In the few seconds this occupied Zarka had regained
the mastery over himself and a certain
amount of composure.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will answer for this outrage, Lieutenant
Von Tressen,&#8221; he said, speaking in a loud harsh
voice. &#8220;It is you who are the ruffian; this is
my private chapel in which you are brawling, and
that lady is my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; Von Tressen returned quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have witnesses to prove it,&#8221; cried Zarka.</p>

<p>&#8220;Witnesses! Who are they?&#8221; Von Tressen
demanded contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;This man is your servant,&#8221; Galabin put in,
pointing to the valet.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this,&#8221; pursued Von Tressen, indicating
the priest who had laid down his book, and was
sitting in one of the altar chairs with as much
dignity as he could retain, &#8220;Is this another of your
servants? Cowardly villain! I will proclaim you
from one end of Europe to the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest, taking his cue to speak, rose and
stepped towards Von Tressen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>&#8220;You are mistaken, sir,&#8221; he said blandly. &#8220;I
am not a suborned domestic masquerading as a
priest. This is no mock marriage. I am Desider
Hornthal, a graduate of the University of Buda,
and priest of the parish of Lilienberg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Von Tressen retorted, &#8220;if you are privy
to this precious piece of villainy you are a disgrace
to your cloth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you leave my chapel?&#8221; cried Zarka.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not,&#8221; Von Tressen answered. &#8220;Neither
shall any man, till we have got to the bottom of
this vile business. Galabin, make fast that door,
there&#8217;s a good fellow. Now, sir,&#8221; he went on,
turning again to Hornthal, &#8220;accepting your statement
about yourself, have you the audacity to tell
me and my friend that the Fr&auml;ulein is that man&#8217;s
wife? Stop! Before you answer I warn you.
I am Lieutenant Von Tressen of the Second Regiment
of Cavalry: my uncle is Staatssecret&auml;r Von
Tressen. This gentleman,&#8221; he pointed to Galabin,
&#8220;is Herr Galabin, in the Bureau of his Excellency
Baron Gersdorff, and we intend this matter shall
be fully brought to light. The reply you give us
you will have to repeat before a tribunal of justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she is my wife,&#8221; exclaimed Zarka
angrily, as the priest hesitated. &#8220;The ceremony&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! A thousand times no!&#8221; cried Philippa.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
&#8220;I swear I am not his wife. Osbert, it was by force
and fraud, and they know it. Even if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, dear,&#8221; said Von Tressen reassuringly.
&#8220;You need have no fear. You, father, do you
confirm Count Zarka, or this lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest had begun to fear he was on the brink
of an ugly scandal. But he was astute enough to
see in a moment on which side his bread was buttered,
and that his line was stoutly to support his
patron.</p>

<p>&#8220;The marriage is undoubtedly duly performed,&#8221;
he answered, unctuously decisive. &#8220;The lady,
although a little hysterical, was quite a willing
party, until she heard you coming, when her manner
altogether changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you, a professor of religion, standing at the
altar, mean to tell me,&#8221; demanded Galabin sternly,
&#8220;that this lady gave her consent to become Count
Zarka&#8217;s wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hornthal was not troubled either by nerves or
superstition, consequently his position, professional
or local, made no difference to his answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. That was my impression before
you came upon the scene.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he looked scared as he had never been before,
and all his suavity seemed to vanish in a guilty
start as a voice, coming behind from the very
depths of the altar, cried, &#8220;It is a lie!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>The priest turned involuntarily, and all looked
wonderingly towards the spot whence the voice
proceeded. The altar-cloth, stiff and heavy with
its elaborate embroidery, was disturbed, then
lifted, and from beneath it appeared a figure at
sight of which Zarka uttered an oath, and Philippa,
transfixed by the apparition, gave a cry of mingled
astonishment and fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prince Roel!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pale and with hollow, sunken eyes, he looked
a weird apparition to their startled imaginations.
For a few moments no one could speak, as the
figure of the Prince stood clutching one corner
of the altar and glaring at them, half fearful, half
defiant.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lie! An impious lie!&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;I
am a witness. It is no marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! Mad fellow!&#8221; cried Zarka. &#8220;What trick
is this. He is mad; pay no heed to his raving!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince made a spring forward but stopped
half way, and stood glaring at him, unable to speak
through the working of his passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You call me mad!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Yes; you
have tried to make me so. But I have escaped
from your diabolical trap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Galabin coolly to Zarka, &#8220;this
is Prince Roel of Rapsburg, whom you, as a creature
of the Russian, have kept here secretly a prisoner&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>&#8220;That you might accuse Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg
of his death,&#8221; Von Tressen cried fiercely, &#8220;and,
by working upon her fears, force her into a marriage
with you. It was the act of a contemptible coward
and a villain! Come, Philippa. We have had
enough of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put out his arm half caressingly, half protectingly
to lead her away. But as they made a
move towards the door, Zarka came quickly forward
and planted himself to intercept them, with
an ugly, determined set to his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not think I shall let you go like this,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;She is my wife, and you touch her at
your peril.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can prove she is not his wife,&#8221; Prince Roel cried
excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I intend,&#8221; Von Tressen said quietly, &#8220;to take
Fr&auml;ulein Harlberg home to her father. If your
assertion be true, you will have ample opportunity
for claiming her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not dictate to me, Lieutenant,&#8221;
Zarka cried in fury. &#8220;In any case you will answer
to me for this insolent intrusion. Now, stand away,
or take the consequences!&#8221;</p>

<p>For reply Von Tressen handed Philippa to Galabin
and advanced towards the door in front of
which Zarka was standing like a tiger at bay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to let us pass, Count?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>&#8220;Certainly not.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another moment Von Tressen had seized hold
of him, and the two men were struggling fiercely.
Strong and well-knit as Zarka was, he was hardly
a match for his younger and more athletic opponent.
A very few seconds&#8217; time sufficed for the Lieutenant
to get the upper hand. He forced Zarka from the
door and then flung him heavily away.</p>

<p>Galabin and Philippa had by this already passed
through the sacristy and out into the hall beyond.
The valet had followed close upon them without
showing any sign of what his intention might be,
and as Von Tressen turned from Zarka to cover
their retreat the Prince sprang before him and
rushed after the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; cried Galabin, seeing Von Tressen
coming after them. &#8220;The sooner we are out of
this place the better. Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>The valet had rushed to the door for which they
were making and locked it. Next moment Prince
Roel&#8217;s fingers were round his throat from behind;
he was pulled backwards and flung, half-throttled,
to the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; Galabin exclaimed, throwing open the
door for Philippa. &#8220;Come with us, Prince; we
must get you away from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philippa, passing out, drew back with a startled
cry. In the doorway stood Zarka, with two swords<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
in his hand. He entered and shut the door behind
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have reckoned without your host, Lieutenant,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You shall not leave my house
without paying for this outrage, or at least till we
have adjusted our differences. We have a score to
settle. You are undeniable as a wrestler; now
let us see if you are equally admirable with edged
tools.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think I am going to fight a duel with you,
Count, you are greatly mistaken,&#8221; answered Von
Tressen.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will have to fight me before you leave
this place,&#8221; Zarka returned. &#8220;It is not the custom
among Hungarian gentlemen to maul one another
like drunken fishwives. We leave that to the
tumblers at our fairs and the dancing dogs. The
world is too small to hold us both. There is your
sword.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw one of the duelling swords down at
Von Tressen&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not in the least afraid of you,&#8221; the Lieutenant
said, &#8220;and should be quite content to
settle our quarrel according to your code. But
I presume not even the custom among Hungarian
gentlemen would sanction my crossing swords
with a man who has flung away all right to be looked
upon as a man of honour.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>Zarka&#8217;s eyes blazed with fury.</p>

<p>&#8220;You swagger well, soldier-boy! But it shall
not serve you. No man ever yet insulted me with
impunity, nor shall you be the first. Pick up that
sword and defend yourself, or take the consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must protest against anything of the sort,&#8221;
interposed Galabin, leaving Philippa and coming
forward. &#8220;The Lieutenant has a perfect right to
refuse your challenge, and you touch an unarmed
man at your peril.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I accept that,&#8221; Zarka retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ignore the presence of the lady about
whom you affect such interest&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Zarka would not listen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take that sword and fight me, Lieutenant,
or I swear I&#8217;ll run you through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you not given proof enough of your
cowardice?&#8221; returned Von Tressen, folding his
arms.</p>

<p>Zarka sprang forward and slashed at him
furiously with his sword. Von Tressen caught the
blow on his arm, and tried to grapple with him,
but Zarka was too alert, and stepping quickly back,
kept him off at the sword&#8217;s point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take your sword!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The situation was serious, for the man was mad
with fury. Galabin reached for the sword and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
put it into Von Tressen&#8217;s hand&mdash;with the warning&mdash;&#8220;Take
care of yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had hardly caught hold of it when Zarka
set upon him furiously. Von Tressen had no time
to get on his guard or even to grasp the weapon
properly, and in an instant a pass from Zarka had
sent it from his hand. With a cry of triumphant
execration Zarka went forward to lunge at him;
Philippa and Galabin both by a common impulse
rushed towards them, but at the same moment
Prince Roel caught up a massive silver candlestick
from a stand by the wall, and flung it with all his
might at Zarka. It struck him full in the face, and
hurled him senseless to the floor.</p>

<small>HOW PRINCE ROEL GOT FREE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Little</span> doubt remaining in the minds of the three
men as to the identity of the masked prisoner, it
had been agreed that a determined attempt to
release him should be made that night. Accordingly,
in pursuance of a carefully devised plan, they set
out together after dark, and making their way to
Rozsnyo climbed the wall, and crawled along the
roof until they reached the barred skylight. As they
approached they saw that the light, without which
their plan would have been frustrated, was there,
and when they came to the grating and looked down,
the figure of the masked man was sitting at the
table reading. So absorbed did he seem in his book
that for some time a tapping on the glass failed to
rouse his attention. At length, however, he looked
up with a start, listened eagerly, they could tell
that, but whether in fear or joy the hideous mask
effectually concealed. Without delay the three
above began to unscrew the bolts of the bars with
tools they had brought with them. This was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
effected without difficulty, and three of the bars
displaced. The more serious obstacle now was the
glass; the only way to remove this was by breaking
it. This was a business which required great care,
and took what, to their impatience, seemed a long
time, but at length a large piece was broken out,
leaving an aperture large enough for the passage
of a man.</p>

<p>With the removal of the glass it was at last possible
to hold communication with the prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Roel!&#8221; D&#8217;Alquen called, in a loud whisper.</p>

<p>The masked one threw out his hands in an impatient
gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he cried, in a voice trembling with
excitement, &#8220;it is you, Abele D&#8217;Alquen, or am I
dreaming? Heaven be thanked! You have come
to release me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we can manage it,&#8221; his kinsman returned.
&#8220;At least, if we do not my life shall pay for our
failure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you have others with you?&#8221; the Prince
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; two friends who have been working for
your release.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, thanks,&#8221; he cried, and the fervour
of his tone contrasted oddly with the hideous
stolidity of the mask. &#8220;You are good fellows to
save a man from torture worse than death.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>A hurried consultation was held and a plan
decided upon. As the height of the room made
escape by the skylight practically impossible,
at least by such means as they could command,
another and far more daring method of rescue had
been hit upon. And this they now proceeded to
put into execution. By the aid of the long stout
strap D&#8217;Alquen was lowered into the room. At
once after a quick hand-shake he began with a file
to cut through the steel fastening of the mask.
To impatient men it was a long operation, but at
last the irksome covering was loose, and Prince
Roel could pull it off with an action of eager relief.
As he did so, the two, watching from above, saw
D&#8217;Alquen start back with a look and an exclamation
of horror. The face which was disclosed was, it
seemed, almost that of a corpse. It was deadly
pale, even livid, wasted and shrunken; the eyes
in their great blue sockets blazed with a feverish
light; it had never been a handsome face; now,
in the tale it told of the unutterable torture of a
living death, it was absolutely appalling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor wretch!&#8221; Galabin exclaimed involuntarily,
averting his eyes. But there was no time for comment.
After that one gasp of horror D&#8217;Alquen,
according to their pre-arranged plan, took the mask
and fitted it to his own head, then he changed coats
with the Prince, telling him the while the details<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
of their scheme. The exchange of attire having
been made, D&#8217;Alquen hastily removed the traces
of the broken glass, and took his seat at the table
in the prisoner&#8217;s usual attitude of reading. At
the same time the Prince took his station behind
the curtains near the door. The positions were
assumed only just in time; indeed, the disturbed
curtain was still moving when the door opened,
and the man who acted as gaoler came in. For
an instant, until he had satisfied himself of his
prisoner&#8217;s whereabouts, he did not leave the door;
then, closing it, he crossed the room with a surly
nod to the mask. For the watchers it was an
anxious moment, but the man&#8217;s casual glance,
though keen enough, did not seem to detect any
difference in the man who sat by the lamp, and indeed
there was not much to be seen. The figures
of the two men were not very dissimilar, and
although D&#8217;Alquen was taller than his kinsman,
this was not observable as he sat leaning over his
book.</p>

<p>The gaoler had a flask of wine in his hand, and
this he set down upon the table. D&#8217;Alquen had
raised his head, and the two men above could tell
that he was watching the fellow, who now crossed
to the screen by the concealed window, and examined
it as though to see whether it had been
tampered with. It was impossible to tell what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
made him do so, but suddenly the man looked up,
and saw the great hole in the skylight. Simultaneously
D&#8217;Alquen rose with the word &#8220;Now!&#8221;
and swiftly moved to the door, before which he took
his stand, covering the gaoler with a pistol. Before
the astonished man could quite realize the situation,
Prince Roel had slipped from his hiding place and
out of the door, which D&#8217;Alquen shut and held,
pistol in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you call out or move I&#8217;ll shoot you dead,&#8221;
was his warning to the gaoler, and the last view
that Von Tressen and Galabin had of the scene was the
sturdy ruffian standing paralyzed before the gleaming
weapon with an ugly grin of discomfiture on his
face.</p>

<p>For no time was to be lost, now that the first
step in the rescue was safely accomplished, in being
ready to help the Prince through its other and more
perilous stages. So Von Tressen and Galabin,
seeing all had gone well so far, made their way
with all haste down from the roof and round to the
door leading from the chapel, which in the plan they
had worked out seemed the shortest and least
hazardous way from the prison-room to open air
and liberty.</p>

<small>ZARKA&#8217;S PRAYER AND ITS ANSWER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> return to the chapel. When Zarka went down
from Prince Roel&#8217;s blow the way of escape seemed
cleared, but no time was to be lost. Leaving
the Count to recover as best he might under the
care of his servant, the party, keeping together for
safety, made their way along a passage which they
judged would lead them in the direction of the
prison-room, where D&#8217;Alquen had been left. But
to find this proved no easy business, and as it turned
out, they might have sought the room for hours
without finding it, had not a lucky circumstance
shown it to them.</p>

<p>Galabin had, as well as he was able from the
information he possessed, made a plan of the
bearings of the room in relation to its position
from the vestibule which led to the chapel and,
on the other side, to the principal entrance of the
castle. He had carefully calculated the distance
as well as the direction, and although in that intricately
constructed building it was far from easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
to make practical use of the plan, he judged after
they had gone a considerable distance, and had
found themselves in a dark stone corridor, that they
were not very far from the room they sought.
Galabin, anticipating its need, had provided himself
with a small lantern, and by the light of this they
searched for the prison chamber. There were three
doors on the left-hand side of the passage; all
of these were unfastened, and each led into an empty
room. On the right-hand side there were no doors,
the stone wall was unbroken. At the end was a
small door admitting to a winding stairway, evidently
leading up into the tower. Prince Roel
seemed to recognize the neighbourhood of his prison,
but his ideas on the subject were vague, and he
was quite unable to point out where the entrance
could be found. His escape from the room had
been made in such excitement that he had noted
nothing except the passage that lay in front of him.</p>

<p>Every moment, they felt, was precious, as the
delay would give Zarka&#8217;s people time to gather
and attack them, which certainly, but for their
chief&#8217;s state of collapse, would have happened
before this. In their extremity Galabin ventured
to call, &#8220;D&#8217;Alquen! D&#8217;Alquen!&#8221; To their great
relief there was an answering cry, coming as it
seemed from the thickness of the wall, and next
moment the apparently solid stonework moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
outwards, and a door, the grooves of which were
secured from observation by depressed lines in the
masonry, opened, and D&#8217;Alquen backed out, revolver
in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, let us get out of this as quickly as we can,&#8221;
Galabin exclaimed.</p>

<p>But how? A hurried consultation was held,
and a plan of escape which seemed to offer least
risk was quickly decided upon. They all passed
into the room, shutting and locking the door behind
them. The gaoler, again held up under the influence
of D&#8217;Alquen&#8217;s pistol, was then compelled
at the muzzle of the same weapon to work back the
iron shutter which concealed the window. This
done, he was pinioned and left securely helpless.
Then by the aid of the long strap which had proved
so useful, all the five let themselves down, one by
one, from the window. There was no sound or
sign of a pursuing party as they crossed the
moat to the wood beyond, down to the valley, and
so along its path towards Gorla&#8217;s Farm. It was
imperative that they should push on to the town
which lay a few miles beyond, in order to insure
Prince Roel&#8217;s safety, and send word to Gersdorff.
Von Tressen took Philippa by the arm and helped
her along the rough ground. For a while the excitement
and reaction were too great to allow her to
speak, although there was in her heart an unspeakable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
joy at the lifting of the shadow of death which
had lain across it. At length she said in a low
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;You understand, now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; Von Tressen answered. &#8220;But at
least this, that I have been led into a hideous
mistake in the suspicions which have been forced
upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was my fault,&#8221; Philippa replied, &#8220;in not
daring to explain. Low as my opinion was of Count
Zarka, I never suspected him of such a monstrous
thing as this, that all this time he was keeping
prisoner the man whose death he persisted at laying
at my door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the duel? That was one of his lies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered quietly. &#8220;It was the
truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her in blank astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;The truth? But how&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; He stopped,
as unable to see the light of a happy explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite true,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;that Fr&auml;ulein
d&#8217;Ivady and I fought&mdash;she for the Count&mdash;I for
my liberty. It was forced upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how came you there, Philippa?&#8221; he asked,
hating himself for the question, yet forced to put it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I lost my way in the forest,&#8221; she explained.
&#8220;I was coming to warn you against the Count,
who had let fall evil threats against you, and I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
frightened by Herr D&#8217;Alquen and driven by his
presence and the storm under the walls of Rozsnyo.&#8221;
Then in a few words she related the story of her
encounter with Royda d&#8217;Ivady. &#8220;I had a terrible
dread of being caught there by the Count,&#8221; she concluded,
&#8220;and preferred to fight that almost mad
girl for a chance of escape. Ah, Osbert, if you had
only known the strange fear with which the Count
inspired me you would see how I must have hated
him to have had the courage to refuse to be his
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all over now,&#8221; he said caressingly.</p>

<p>She gave a little shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could think so. But I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not fear now, dearest,&#8221; he said reassuringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not for myself, but for you,&#8221; she returned.
&#8220;Zarka is vindictive and cruel; he will never rest
till he has revenged himself for his defeat to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is utterly discredited now,&#8221; Von Tressen
urged. &#8220;When this is known he will be a criminal
and a fugitive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But a desperate one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps. But you will not make me afraid of
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had now reached the farm, and giving the
astonished Harlberg in a few words an account of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
what happened at Rozsnyo, the four men made
for the encampment, harnessed the horse, and pushed
forward to the town. Having seen Prince Roel
safely to the principal inn of the place, and leaving
Galabin and D&#8217;Alquen with him, Von Tressen drove
back to Gorla&#8217;s Farm.</p>

<p>All was quiet; there seemed to have been no
further attempt on Zarka&#8217;s part, although, in his
present desperate position, this had been far from
unlikely. Securing his horse by the gate, Von
Tressen kept watch over the place until well into
the morning, when the inmates of the house were
astir. Then he went in to talk over with Harlberg
and Philippa the arrangements for their immediate
departure from the forest. The General was in
good spirits, rejoicing in his freedom to resume
his real name and at the prospect of release from
his exile, and quite content to accept the engagement
between Von Tressen and Philippa, since the
Count was now an impossibility.</p>

<p>After breakfast Von Tressen drove off to the encampment
in order to have their things packed, as
he intended to make the journey with Harlberg
and Philippa. He had arranged to meet Galabin
there, and as he drove up found his friend awaiting
him.</p>

<p>The preparations for their departure were set
about quickly. The servant, Bela, was busy filling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
a basket with cooking utensils while Von Tressen
and Galabin were packing their valises inside the
tent. Suddenly the light was intercepted. Both
men turned quickly, to see standing in the entrance
the figure of Count Zarka. His lowering face was
hideously disfigured by a great dark swelling across
the cheek and forehead; his eyes, notwithstanding
that one was half closed, seemed to sparkle with
hate, and the teeth were displayed in a set grin.
Neglecting all his customary parade of salutation
he stood there quite still, moving nothing but his
lip as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, gentleman. I have come to
settle an account with you. Before we proceed
further will you have the goodness to send your man
away?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment neither replied. Then Galabin
said: &#8220;We can have nothing more to do with you,
Count, and as our servant is busy we cannot interrupt
his work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka gave a shrug and came two steps into the
tent. &#8220;As you will. It makes little difference.
Last night, Lieutenant Von Tressen,&#8221; he continued,
keeping back as he spoke the corners of his mouth
so that the rows of white teeth seemed to snap
out the words as though a wolf had found speech,
&#8220;you refused to fight me. You will not refuse
again.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>The last words were not a question, but the
expression of a purpose.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant faced him sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I shall,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;I have too
great a respect for my honour and that of my
uniform to meet the man you have shown yourself
to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; Zarka snarled. &#8220;You refuse finally?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Finally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I tell you you are a coward!&#8221; Von
Tressen laughed. &#8220;That I will proclaim you a
coward all over Europe!&#8221; Zarka proceeded, his
voice rising with each sentence. &#8220;That I will
flog you in public whenever I shall meet you. That
is nothing to you, my swaggerer, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; Von Tressen answered quietly,
&#8220;from the man in Russia&#8217;s pay who kidnapped
Prince Roel and planned a dastardly outrage on a
defenceless lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka gave no sign that the words stung him.
In a tone as quiet as Von Tressen&#8217;s he continued:
&#8220;No; that is nothing to you, my brave fellow.
But when I tell you,&#8221; and here his voice sank to
a hissing whisper, &#8220;that unless you consent to
face my pistol now, I will kill you, yes, kill you
as assuredly as there is a sun in the sky, kill you
within a month, you will perhaps, knowing something
of my character and that there is nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
on earth I dare not do, when once I am resolved,
I say perhaps you will see the desirability of meeting
me in fair fight without further delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Von Tressen laughed scornfully. &#8220;Not even
on the flattering grounds that I am afraid of you,&#8221;
he replied. &#8220;And I must ask you, Count, to leave
the tent, as we are busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant Zarka&#8217;s eyes blazed. Galabin
watching keenly, saw the evil light and drew a step
nearer. But the murderous impulse, for such it
surely must have been, was stifled for the moment,
and the Count stood silent as meditating his parting
words. However, Galabin spoke first.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy, Count, instead of threatening honourable
men you will have enough to do to look after your
own safety. If you do not immediately quit this
tent we shall consider it our duty to arrest you,
in anticipation of those whom the law will have
put upon your track in a few hours&#8217; time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zarka, who had not appeared to notice him before,
now turned his savage glance from the Lieutenant.
&#8220;You too, Herr Galabin,&#8221; he said with the same
ugly grin. &#8220;You must pardon me if I seemed to
ignore you. When I have settled accounts with
your friend I shall have an opportunity of meting
out to you the reward of&mdash;a spy. I will not detain
you, gentlemen. The short time before you should
be yours. The future and a certain lady are for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
me. <i>Au revoir</i>, gentlemen.&#8221; He turned abruptly,
and next moment was gone.</p>

<p>Galabin laughed, though not very confidently.
&#8220;The sooner we are out of this forest, and the Herr
Graf is in the safe keeping of the law, the better for
us all, my friend. Bela,&#8221; he called, &#8220;which way
did the Count go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Towards Rozsnyo, mein Herr.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us lose no time in making for Gorla&#8217;s
and so for civilization,&#8221; Galabin observed to Von
Tressen. &#8220;The man is desperate, and the symptoms
are none the less dangerous for being suppressed.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile Count Zarka had mounted and ridden
back to Rozsnyo. He knew that, for a time at
any rate, the dangerous game he had been playing
was up; his only chance now was to put the mountains
and the frontier between himself and Gersdorff&#8217;s
long arm. The mere failure of the political side
of the business would have troubled him but little;
he was a gambler who knew how to lose as well as
win, and at most this discomfiture would mean but
a year or two&#8217;s exile till the affair was forgotten,
or crowded out of attention by more engrossing
international movements. What made him clench
his wolfish teeth, scowl as he rode along, and startle
the forest denizens by loud ejaculations of rage,
was the maddening thought of failure nearer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
his heart, that he had been worsted in the fight for
Philippa Carlstein. It was that which made him
vow and curse, and dig his heels savagely into the
roan&#8217;s flanks.</p>

<p>On reaching Rozsnyo he went in by his private
door, and for an hour was busy making secret
preparations for his flight. Having put things
in order and destroyed certain papers, he took a
gun and went out. As he crossed the bridge he
could see that he was being watched from a window;
he waved his hand carelessly to Royda, cursing her
in his heart all the while as the indirect cause of his
discomfiture. The action, almost brutal in its
perfunctoriness, nevertheless brought a flush to
the pale face, which watched him till the wood hid
him from sight. For she knew nothing of the last
night&#8217;s fierce doings, and if she had known she
might have welcomed the crisis as putting her rival
out of reach.</p>

<p>Zarka&#8217;s way was one he had often traversed,
that leading to the pass over the mountains. The
afternoon was still brilliant as he reached the snow
line, and turned to take breath after his rapid climb.
For he had set forth in a state of vicious excitement
for which action and waste of energy were the only
safety-valves. Even when he had halted on the
lower plateau he could not keep still, but restlessly
paced to and fro in irregular strides, now stopping,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
now starting forward again as his thoughts seemed
to whip him into action.</p>

<p>The disfigurement of his face showed plainer now;
the swelling and discoloration adding ugliness
of feature to that of temper which blazed malignantly
from his eyes.</p>

<p>He lighted a cigar and walked on scowling;
his progress was slower now, for the track was rough
and tortuous.</p>

<p>Suddenly in his walk he stopped, and flung out
his arms with a cry of &#8220;Hail!&#8221; The giant shadow
of the mountain had appeared with startling abruptness,
and now towered with weird vastness above
him, seeming to rise from the chasm below. The
suddenness of the apparition seemed for a moment
to have shaken his nerves, but it was merely a
flash of fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;An omen!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Ah, my good genius,
have you come again to give me courage? Zarka
of the cloud and storm, help this fettered, passion-tossed
Zarka of blood and clay. Give me my
heart&#8217;s desire, or at least a sign that I shall gain it.
God or demon, do with me what thou wilt so thou
grant me this. Zarka of the mist and mountain,
give me my prayer. I have never known defeat,
my guardian genius, let me never know it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Up from the profundity of the yawning abyss
before him came a great suppressed sighing as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
wind swept through the fissured depths. A big
bird of the vulture family flew suddenly down to
the mouth of the chasm, circled about, and sighting
the man there, wheeled off with a cry of angry
surprise. The spectre of the mountain slowly faded
as the sun dipped behind the topmost peak; the
mist began to rise and roll, and the cloud to assert
its sway.</p>

<p>Zarka, who had stood since his apostrophe in
lowering meditation, started forward as though
with a suddenly formed determination. His disfigured
face lighted up with diabolical triumph,
and he laughed aloud as he hastened back along
the path. Such a laugh! The laugh of a gambler
who throws his last coin on the green table, a laugh
that flings defiance at God and man, and utters
the old invocation, &#8220;Evil be thou my Good!&#8221;
A laugh that was echoed back from across the
abyss, and reverberated on and on through the
rocky walls and chasms of the mountain, on and on,
after the human voice that had uttered it was silent
for ever. For the laugh had been crushed out of
those lying lips into a scream by the rush of a sudden
&#8220;<i>lavine</i>,&#8221; or avalanche, which swept with terrific
swiftness down the sloping wall of rock, bounded
on to the ledge which just perceptibly checked its
sheer descent, then, crashing over the precipice,
flung itself into the abyss with a thunder which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
echoes prolonged and redoubled till it seemed as
though the very mountain would be rent.</p>

<p>And the path was empty. Count Zarka was
never more to know failure as he lay a thousand feet
below, swept out of the world by a force that would
have annihilated a regiment. And as the echoes
of the fall died away they were followed by that
of a scream, the cry of the vulture, swooping back
and hovering in baffled voracity over the grave of
his human brother.</p>

<p><i>The Illustrated London News</i> says&mdash;&#8220;Humdrum is the very last word
you could apply to (a tale by) E. P. Oppenheim, which reminds you of one of
those Chinese nests of boxes, one inside the other. You have plot within plot,
wheel within wheel, mystery within mystery, till you are almost dizzy.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>The British Weekly</i> says&mdash;&#8220;Mr. Oppenheim has boundless imagination
and distinct skill. He paints in broad, vivid colours; yet, audacious as he is,
he never outsteps the possible. There is good thrilling mystery in his books,
and not a few excellent characters.&#8221;</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
